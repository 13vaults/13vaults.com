The following rules apply to both the Ranger (_13th Age_) and the Druid (_13 True Ways_) with the corresponding talent.

_The Core Book version of this talent takes two talent slots.<br/> If you want to invest one or three talents in your companion, check other versions of this talent._
</If>

## Overview
You have a devoted animal companion who fights alongside you like a member of your adventuring party.

### Recoveries

<If version="13 True Ways">
Add two recoveries to your total recoveries as an adept, or only one recovery as an initiate. You can use a recovery on yourself or your animal companion.
</If>
<If version="Core Book">
Add two recoveries to your total recoveries. You can use a recovery on yourself or your animal companion.
</If>

### Actions

Your animal companion acts on your initiative turn, either immediately before or after you, depending on the animal type.

Your animal companion moves gets a move action and a standard action, but not a quick action.

If you have powers that care about the 'first time you attack an enemy,' an attack by your animal companion counts as your attack.

<If version="13 True Ways">
## Animal Companion Initiate
If you invest a single talent into Animal Companion, you have an
animal companion as detailed below.

However, your animal companion **can only fight by your side every other battle**.

### Calling your companion
 You can choose whether or not
you want your animal companion to take part in a battle when
you roll initiative.
If you don’t include your companion in a battle and later
wish to do so, you can call your companion with a quick action.
At the start of your next turn, your companion either turns up
at your side, or runs in from some offstage angle if you have a
convincing story for why it wasn’t alongside you to begin with.

Once you’ve called your animal
companion to fight alongside you in a battle, it’s not available for
the next battle after that. Unlike most all our other powers, this
limitation applies between full heal-ups, between adventures,
and even between gaining levels. Consequently, it’s entirely
possible that you may decide to have your animal companion
miss two battles in a row.

### Death rules
If your animal companion
dies, it’s gone for that battle. You can summon another animal
companion to the next battle it’s eligible to fight in, or perhaps
explain how druidic magic returns your original companion to
life, but that new/returned companion will be one level lower
than normal (two levels lower than you, in other words) for that
battle. After that battle, your animal companion returns to its
normal level (generally one level below you).

## Animal Companion Adept
If you invest two talents into Animal Companion, you get
a companion that fights at your side in every battle, and you also gain a number
of spells to help your animal companion fight better.

_If you aren’t comfortable with your ranger
casting spells, go ahead and reinterpret the spells as the results
of training or inspiration rather than magic._

| Character Level      | Daily Spells | Level the Spells are Cast At |
|------------------|--------------|-----------------------------|
| Level 1 Multiclass | 1          | 1st level                   |
| Level 1          | 1            | 1st level                   |
| Level 2          | 2            | 1st level                   |
| Level 3          | 2            | 3rd level                   |
| Level 4          | 2            | 3rd level                   |
| Level 5          | 3            | 5th level                   |
| Level 6          | 3            | 5th level                   |
| Level 7          | 3            | 7th level                   |
| Level 8          | 4            | 7th level                   |
| Level 9          | 4            | 9th level                   |
| Level 10         | 4            | 9th level                   |

As usual, multiclass characters are one level behind on this table.

## Multiple Companions
Druids and rangers don’t necessarily
have only one animal companion. They just have one companion
at a time. Druids who also have the Terrain Caster talent are more
likely to call on an animal companion that suits their current
adventuring conditions. Depending on your character’s story,
your animal companion may represent one faithful creature who
sticks with you or a succession of wild beasts

</If>


## Animal Harm

Your animal companion can be healed like an ally.
If it gets healed without you being healed, it uses one of your recoveries. When you use a recovery while next to your animal companion (including being engaged with the same enemy), your animal companion is also healed using a free recovery.

Instead of dying like a monster or NPC at 0 hp, your animal companion follows PC rules for falling unconscious at 0 hp and dying after four failed death saves or when its negative hit points equal half its normal hit points.
If your animal companion dies, you can summon another one.
If you're still on the same adventure, you can call a new animal companion the next day, but it will be one level lower than an animal companion would normally be.
At the start of a new adventure, or when you gain a level, bump the companion up to its proper level.

## Stats &amp; Levels

Each animal companion has roughly the same base stats as listed below.

Your animal companion is always one level lower than you.
As a 1st level ranger, you'll have a level 0 animal companion.
Once you gain a level, your animal companion rises to 1st level.

On top of the base stats, each type of animal has a zoologically appropriate power or advantage.

## Companion Species

Each type of animal companion is a little different.

<Vault.AbilityList
  abilities={props.getAbilitiesByType("Animal Companion")}
/>

## Level Progression

Use the following stats as the baseline for your animal companion. Remember that your companion stays a level lower than you.
Generally your companion's Physical Defense should be higher than its Mental Defense, but you could flip that if you have a good explanation.

| Level | Attack     | Damage | AC  | PD (or MD) | MD (or PD) | HP        |
| ----- | ---------- | ------ | --- | ---------- | ---------- | --------- |
| 0     | +5 vs. AC  | d8     | 16  | 14         | 10         | 20 (10)   |
