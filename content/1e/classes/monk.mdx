  - name: JAB, PUNCH, and KICK Attacks
    _type: Class Feature
    description: |-
      Under normal circumstances, melee weapons that are traditional in a monk’s style function like special effects for monks.
      Most monk attacks are rated as JAB, PUNCH, or KICK attacks, in the same sense that most fighter attacks are WEAPON attacks.

      - JAB attacks deal 1d6 damage per level. 
      - PUNCH attacks deal 1d8 damage per level. 
      - KICK attacks deal 1d10 damage per level. 

      Monks don’t use weapon damage dice unless they are using a non-traditional weapon or a basic ranged attack that is not part of one of their monk forms.

      When fighting barehanded, with bracers, or with traditional monk weapons, monks use damage dice based on the form they are attacking with, or PUNCH damage for basic melee attacks.
      While using a magic weapon, monks add the weapon’s attack and damage bonus to their attacks, and they can use that weapon’s power(s).

      All monk attacks that use Dexterity as the attack stat use Strength as the ability score that determines damage.
  - name: Forms
    _type: Class Feature
    description: |-
      When you learn a monk form, you learn all three elements of that form: an **opening attack**, **flow attack**, and **finishing attack**.
      Each element generally requires a standard action to use.

      Your first standard action attack in a battle must be an opening.
      Your second attack can be a flow attack from any form you know, or it can be another opening.
      After you use a flow attack, your next monk attack must be a finishing attack from any form you know, or it can be another opening.
      (You can’t use flow attack twice in a row.)
      After a finishing attack you must start over with an opening on your next standard action.
      If you do not attack one turn, you must start over with an opening on your next standard action.
      This form progression applies whether you hit or miss with your attack.

      As long as you use the proper element of the form (opening, flow, or finishing attack),
      you can use an opening, flow, or finishing attack from ANY of the forms you know.

      When you use an element of a form, you gain an AC bonus until the start of your next turn.
      After using an opening attack you gain a +1 bonus to AC. After using a flow attack, you gain a +2 bonus to AC.
      After using a finishing attack, you gain a +3 bonus to AC.
      If _elven grace_ or some other power lets you use multiple elements of your forms in a turn,
      the AC bonuses don’t stack but you do get to use the highest bonus.
  - name: Ki
    _type: Class Feature
    description: |-
      You gain a number of ki points each day equal to 1 + your Wisdom modifier.
      You can spend ki to modify the natural result of one of your attack rolls.
      Ki is a daily resource.
      When you take a full heal-up, you regain all your ki points.
      You don’t regain ki during a quick rest.

      After rolling an attack, you can spend 1 point of ki as a free action to change your attack’s natural result by 1,
      unless that result is a natural 1.
      The change can be +1 or -1.
      Spending ki is a free action, but you can only spend 1 point of ki each turn.
    feats:
      - tier: adventurer
        description: You gain 1 additional point of ki each day.

  - name: Two-Weapon Fighting
    _type: Class Feature
    description: |-
      Since monks are trained to strike with all their limbs, they can always be considered to be fighting with two weapons in melee, even when they’re barehanded.
      The principal advantage of “two-weapon fighting” is that you get to reroll your attack when you roll a natural 2 with a melee attack, sticking with the reroll.
  - name: Bracers as Magic Items
    _type: Class Feature
    description: |-
      Monks get magic-weapon style powers from magical bracers.
      In practice, a monk fighting barehanded looks to bracers for magical advantage.
      A monk who fights with the monastery’s traditional weapons might use bracers or a magical weapon,
      but a monk wearing magical bracers can’t use a magical melee weapon at the same time.

      ### Ki Power

      _(A Thousand Palms)_: You must be engaged with 2 or more enemies to use this power.
      After making a Flurry attack, you can spend 1 point of ki to make another Flurry attack against a target you have not already attacked with Flurry this turn.

    _type: Talent
    tier: adventurer
    description: |-
      If you use Greeting Fist in a battle, you can’t use any other Seven Deadly Secrets talent that battle.

      The first time you make a melee attack against each enemy during a battle (including the first mook of a mob),
      the target takes 1d8 extra damage on a hit.

      2nd level monk: 2d6 extra damage.

      4th level monk: 2d8 extra damage.

      6th level monk: 4d6 extra damage.

      8th level monk: 4d10 extra damage.

      10th level monk: 6d12 extra damage.

      ### Ki Power

      _(Opening the Death Gate)_:
      When you deal Greeting Fist damage, you can spend 1 point of ki to double that damage
      (as usual, a crit would then triple that damage).
    feats:
      - tier: adventurer
        description: Once per battle when you miss with your first melee attack against an enemy, you can use Greeting Fist against that enemy later that battle.
      - tier: champion
        description: When you successfully disengage from an enemy, that enemy takes damage equal to your level. Popping free doesn’t count; the damage only applies when you use the disengage action. (This damage doesn’t count as an attack, so if you hadn’t attacked that enemy yet, you could still use Greeting Fist on it later.)
      - tier: epic
        description: Once per battle, reroll an attack that qualified for Greeting Fist damage.
  - name: Temple Weapon Master (Seven Deadly Secrets)
    _type: Talent
    usage: per-battle
    tier: adventurer
    description: |-
      If you use Temple Weapon Master in a battle, you can’t use any other Seven Deadly Secrets talents that battle.

      Once per battle while you’re fighting with a weapon or weapons associated with your monastic tradition, you can turn a natural even miss into a hit.

      ### Ki Power

      _(Supreme Warrior Discipline)_: When you use your Temple Weapon Master power,
      you can spend 1 point of ki to gain a bonus to AC equal to the current escalation die until an attack against AC misses you or until the end of the battle.
      (The AC bonus increases or decreases as the escalation die increases or decreases.)
    feats:
      - tier: adventurer
        description: The AC bonus from the ki power also applies to your PD. An attack against your PD that misses also ends the bonus.
      - tier: champion
        description: When you roll a natural 2 with a monk attack while fighting with your monastic weapons, in addition to the reroll you get from Two-Weapon Fighting, you gain a bonus to the rerolled attack equal to your Strength modifier or your Wisdom modifier.

        description: One battle per day, the damage dice of your finishing attacks increase by one size (max d12). (For example, d10s become d12s.)
  - name: Diamond Focus
    _type: Talent
    tier: adventurer
    description: |-
      You gain a +2 bonus to saves while you’re not staggered.

      In addition, you can go one round without using a monk attack form and still maintain your place in the attack form progression.
      For example, if you made an opening attack last round but don’t attack this round (or with your next standard action) for any reason,
      even being stunned or unconscious, you can still use a flow attack with your next standard action.

      ### Ki Power

      _(Diamond Soul)_: When you are dazed, weakened, or stunned, you can spend 1 point of ki to make an immediate normal save (11+).
      If you succeed, the effect ends.
      If you fail, the condition affects you normally.
      (This power also works on effects that aren’t save ends.
      It also breaks the stunned rule by letting you use a free action to spend ki.)
    feats:
      - tier: adventurer
        description: You can also use the ki power to save when you’re confused or hampered.
      - tier: champion
        description: The ki power save is now an easy save (6+).
      - tier: epic
        description: You can also use the ki power to save against a last gasp effect (but it doesn’t count against your total if you fail).
  - name: Heaven’s Arrow
    _type: Talent
    usage: per-battle
    description: |-
      Unlike other monks, you have no attack penalty with ranged weapons, including thrown weapons, longbows, shortbows, and crossbows.
      Your basic ranged attacks also deal miss damage equal to your level.

      Once per battle when you would make a melee attack as an element of one of your monk forms, you can use a ranged attack against a nearby enemy instead.
      This attack deals damage according to the JAB/PUNCH/KICK hierarchy that’s part of the form rather than WEAPON damage like basic attacks.

      ### Ki Power

      _(Wind from Heaven)_: You can spend 1 point of ki to regain your Heaven’s Arrow power when it’s expended.
    feats:
      - tier: adventurer
        description: You can now target enemies that are far away when you use the Heaven’s Arrow power. The ranged weapon you’re using might have an attack penalty against far away enemies, but your attack otherwise functions as normal.

        description: You can now use the Heaven’s Arrow power twice per battle.
      - tier: epic

    _type: Talent
    usage: per-battle
    tier: adventurer
    description: |-
      Once per battle when you use a move action, you can take another move action as a free action.

      In addition, if you fall with a wall, tree, or other physical object next to you, you can fall up to 30 feet per level without taking damage.
      (You slap the surface, catch handholds, and use other maneuvers to slow your descent.)

      ### Ki Power

      _(Wind’s Comrade)_: You can spend 1 point of ki during your turn to gain flight until the end of your turn.
    feats:
      - tier: adventurer
        description: You gain a +3 bonus to disengage checks.
      - tier: champion
        description: When an enemy makes an attack against you that targets more than one creature, you only take half damage from that attack, hit or miss.
      - tier: epic
        description: Roll a normal save at the end of any turn in which you use the ki power. If you succeed, your flight lasts until the end of your next turn. (It’s not advisable to count on this working by staying in midair, though you could of course fly next to a wall, counting on your ability to slow your fall as outlined above!)
  - name: Overworld Lineage, aka Phoenix-touched
    _type: Talent
    tier: adventurer
    description: |-
      If you wish, any time an element of the monk class refers to Wisdom, you can replace that element with a reference to Charisma.

      In addition, while you’re staggered, when you roll a natural even attack roll,
      you heal damage equal to your Strength modifier or your Wisdom modifier (double that modifier at 5th level; triple it at 8th level).

      ### Ki Power

      _(Imperial Phoenix Flare)_:
      Once per day when you are staggered, you can spend 1 point of ki to heal using a recovery.
      You heal half the hit points you roll for the recovery, and one enemy engaged with you of your choice takes the other half in fire damage.
    feats:
      - tier: adventurer
        description: You can now use this ki power twice per day.
      - tier: champion
        description: Once per day after rolling a death save, you can gain +4 bonus to the roll.

        description: The first time you die after taking this feat, you are resurrected at a place of power like your home monastery or other sanctum between one and four days later, assuming another resurrection doesn’t find you first. (This counts against your normal resurrection limit, as normal.)
  - name: Spinning Willow Style
    _type: Talent
    tier: adventurer
    description: |-
      When a ranged attack or close-quarters attack that targets AC hits you, you can roll a normal save.

    _type: Talent
    tier: champion

      When you gain this talent, choose a class:
      cleric, sorcerer, or wizard.
      Each time you take a full heal-up, choose a non-feature spell of your level or lower from that class.
      You can’t choose the same spell twice in a row; you must choose a different option each time you take a full heal-up.

      If the spell is at-will, you can cast it in place of a flow attack.
      If the spell is limited use, you can cast it in place of a finishing attacks.
      Use your Wisdom as the ability score that determines attack and damage with the spell.

      ### Ki Power

      _(Gather the Flame)_:
      You can spend 1 point of ki when you cast your Disciple of the Hidden Flame spell to cast it as
      if you possessed the adventurer-tier and champion-tier feat for that spell, if any.
      At 8th level, treat the spell like you possessed the epic-tier feat for it, if any, when you spend the ki.

      Once per battle as a quick action, you can pull off an outrageous improvisational stunt that no one else could manage,
      with the possible exception of a swashbuckling rogue!
      The stunt is not itself an attack but it might lead to one.

      The outrageous action of your stunt isn’t something you have to roll for, even if it would ordinarily require a skill check to pull off,
      though you’ll still have to roll for an attack that follows up your stunt.

      ### Ki Power

      Each character who succeeds regains all spells, powers, hit points, ki,
