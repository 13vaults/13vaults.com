  - name: Bardic Songs
    _type: Class Feature
    description: |-
      Bardic songs last for one or more rounds and end with a final verse that carries a big payoff.
      Although magical, bardic songs don’t count as spells;
      they don’t force the bard to suffer opportunity attacks from engaged enemies, and they can’t be canceled by effects that can cancel spells.
      In fact, bards can cast spells while in the middle of singing a bardic song.

      Each song specifies what type of action starts it.
      To sustain it during the next round, it requires an action and a d20 check against its sustain target.
      If successful, the song can continue with its sustained effect for that round.
      (The next round will require another sustain check.)
      If your attempt to sustain a song fails, the song’s final verse effect resolves immediately, and then the song’s power ends.
      You can start another song on your next round.

      You don’t have to try to sustain the song at the start of your turn.
      If you choose not to sustain a song, its effects end immediately and you choose whether to use the song’s final verse effect in the current round or to start a new song.
      You can’t do both.

      Some songs have an immediate effect that happens each time you start or sustain the song.
      Others have effects that continue throughout the entire round.

      Most songs stop when a bard is knocked unconscious, silenced, or stunned.
      Having your song stopped this way prevents you from getting the final verse effect.

      You can only sing one bardic song at a time.
      If you are singing a song (or spend an action to try to sustain a song), you can’t start another song that round.

      Bardic songs are loud, and cancel any of stealth effects you may have.

          Your bardic songs don’t stop immediately when you are knocked unconscious, stunned, or silenced.
          Instead, they continue for one round, giving you the chance to sustain the song on your next turn.
  - name: Battle Cries
    _type: Class Feature
    description: |-
      Bards use battle cries to encourage, inspire, warn, and magically aid their allies.
      Battle cries are triggered by flexible melee attacks.
      The bard makes a melee attack and is able to use a battle cry that corresponds to the attack’s natural result, sometimes whether or not the attack hits.

      Bonuses provided by battle cries can help a bard’s allies but not the bard.
    feats:
      - tier: adventurer
        description:
          You can generate the effect of any 1st or 3rd level battle cry you know as a standard action (instead of making a flexible melee attack to see which battle cry you are able to trigger).
          This allows you to choose the particular battle cry you want, at the expense of taking your standard action.
  - name: Spells
    _type: Class Feature
    description: |-
      Bards use arcane spells that function like those of other spell-casting classes. Some spells are daily, some recharge, and others are at-will.
      Unlike most character classes, bards use two different ability scores for their attacks. Their melee and ranged weapon attacks use Strength or Dexterity, while their spells use Charisma.
  - name: Balladeer
    _type: Talent
    description: |-
      At each level, including 1st level, you may learn a great ballad of your choice.
      Each day you can sing one of these songs to give you a positive relationship with an icon that you would not ordinarily have…as well as increasing a negative relationship with another icon.

      Song choices for the great ballad are up to the role-player.

      It takes at least a few rounds to sing a great ballad, so ideally it happens outside of combat.
      As you sing the ballad, it’s an opportunity to tell the GM what’s special about the story you are telling.

      Make a Charisma skill check using your best singing or musical background.
      If you succeed, you gain 2 points of positive relationship with the chosen icon for the rest of the day (until the next full heal-up).
      The DC depends on the environment:

      **DC 15:** Adventurer environment

      **DC 20:** Champion environment

      **DC 25:** Epic environment

      You can use these points to roll relationship dice the way you roll your normal icon relationships (see Icon Relationships).
      If you already have positive or conflicted dice with the icon you’ve sung about, add them to your new bonus dice.
      If you have negative dice with the icon you’ve sung a ballad to, they can be temporarily overruled by the ballad, but the GM should feel free to interpret any 5s rolled with a heavy hand.

      When your great ballad magically compliments an icon, another icon should take a hit.
      As you explain the story of your ballad to the GM, you should account for at least one icon who is being mocked, vilified, or referred to in unflattering terms.
      You get an equal number of cursed dice for that icon.
      Cursed dice aren’t like negative relationship dice—they never help you.
      At the GM’s option, you’ll have to roll these cursed dice at least once and interpret them as possible problems for you: rolls of 1 are a definite problem; rolls of 2 mean there are story complications connected to the temporary enemy icon.
    feats:
      - tier: adventurer
        description: The first time you use your ballad-created relationship, any 5s you roll become 6s. You also gain a +2 bonus to your Balladeer checks.
