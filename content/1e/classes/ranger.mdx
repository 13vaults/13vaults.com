      2. Your pet is fully natural rather than partially magical.

      You have the Tracker background at its full possible bonus of +5, without having to spend your normal background points on it.
      You are an expert wilderness tracker, capable of reading clues from the environment that others can’t perceive.
      Tracking doesn’t work well, however, in heavily traveled urban environments.

      In addition, you have the terrain stunt power.

      **Terrain stunt:** At the start of each battle in a non-urban environment, roll a d6.
      Any time after the escalation die reaches that number, you’ll be able to use a quick action to execute a terrain stunt.
      Normally you can only use terrain stunt once per battle, but circumstances, geography, or excellent planning may suggest that you can pull it off more than once.

      Terrain stunts are improvisational effects that play off your preternatural understanding of the wilderness and all the diverse forms of the natural world.
      Things like knocking a hornets nest no one had noticed onto your enemy’s head,
      maneuvering a foe onto a soggy patch of ground that slows them down,
      shooting the cap off a mushroom spore in a dungeon that erupts on your enemies,
      getting your enemy’s sword wedged into a stalactite,
      finding the tree branch that lets you vault up to attack the flying demon that thought it was out of axe range,
      and similar types of actions.
    feats:
      - tier: adventurer
        description: Your grasp of the way the world is put together increases; you now can use terrain stunt in urban environments.
      - tier: champion
        description: You can track as well in urban areas as you do in the wilderness.

      **This talent has been reworked in _13 True Ways_,

      It is shared with the Druid as the Circle of the Fang.**

      If you would rather have a smaller beast as a pet, see the Ranger’s Pet talent.

      As a ranger, you may take one, two or three talents in this group,

      If you aren’t comfortable with your ranger casting spells,

    source: DATP
    description: |
      _You practice a mystic form of archery that infuses your arrows with arcane
      magic
      as you shoot._
  
      If you spend one talent, you are an Arcane Archer initiate, with two, you become
      an Arcane Archer adept.
  
      To use an Arcane Archer power _(see below)_, declare that you are using it
      before making a ranged weapon attack. You then pay the cost of the power,
      usually one charge for a 1st or 3rd level power, or 2 charges for 5th level
      power. You then apply the effect of the power to your ranged attack. If you make
      more than one attack, such as with the Double Ranged Attack talent, your Arcane
      Archer power only applies to one of those attacks. If you want to use them with
      more than one attack, pay the cost each time.
      If you are an initiate, you have a number of charges equal to your Wisdom
      modifier, as an adept, you have your Wisdom modifier +3.
  
      You regain all expended charges during a full heal-up. When you take a quick
      rest, you regain one charge as an initiate, or two as an adept.
  
      You can only apply one power to each ranged attack, unless you have one of the
      feats below that allow you to stack multiple powers of one sphere.
  
      **Feats**: You don’t need to take the feats below in order.

      Like a Terrain Caster, you don’t need to prepare a spell in advance. When you
      decide to cast a spell, choose one from the list of the terrain(s) you are
      currently in, at your level or lower. If the spell is an at-will or once-per-
      battle spell, you regain your spell slot at the end of the battle or scene. If
      the spell is a daily spell, you regain the spell slot at your next full heal-up.
  
      In addition, once per day per point of Wisdom modifier, you can commune with the
      spirits of nature to gain advantage on a skill check related to the surrounding
      terrain. For example, beast spirits can help you track game, river spirits can
      point to a source of freshwater, and earth spirits can make climbing easier.

      Once per battle, you can perform a stunt as a move action to climb on a large or
      huge enemy. This does not require a skill check. You get a firm grip on their
      back, where you are in position to reach their weak points, but you are hard to
      reach for claws and teeth. The enemy has disadvantage on attacks against you,
      while you have advantage on attacks against them.
  
      If you are still on the enemy on any further turns, roll a normal save (11+). On
      a success, you remain in position. On a natural even failure, you cling on but
      lose advantage. On a natural odd failure, you fall off.

## Arcane Archer Powers
If you are an Arcane Archer, you gain a number of powers depending on whether you are
an initiate or adept, and your level.

| Ranger Level | Powers Known (Initiate) | Powers Known (Adept) |
|--------------|--------------|-----------|
| 1            | 2            | 3          |

| 4            | 3            | 5          |
| 5            | 3            | 5          |

| 10           | 5            | 8          |
    
The Arcane Archer powers are organized in spheres,
with each sphere containing a 1st, 3rd, and 5th level power.

You can choose the 1st and 3rd level powers from any sphere as long as
you have the required level, but to access the 5th level power,
you also need both the 1st and 3rd level powers of that sphere.
