      When fighting with two one-handed melee weapons, your default option is to make a double melee attack.

      Your weapon damage die drops one notch, usually from d8s to d6s.
      If your first attack is a natural even roll (hit or miss), you can make a second attack as a free action.

      If you decide you don’t want to try for a double melee attack while fighting with two one-handed weapons,
      declare it before rolling your attack; the single attack will deal the normal damage dice instead of using reduced damage dice.

    _type: Talent
    tier: adventurer
    description: |-
      You have a small animal or beast that accompanies you on your adventures.
      Use the rules from the Wizard’s Familiar talent with the following differences:

      1. The creature is your pet or friend instead of your familiar.
      2. Your pet is fully natural rather than partially magical.
      3. Your pet can end up with more abilities, if you choose.
    feats:

  - name: Tracker
    _type: Talent
    tier: adventurer
    description: |-
      You have the Tracker background at its full possible bonus of +5, without having to spend your normal background points on it.
      You are an expert wilderness tracker, capable of reading clues from the environment that others can’t perceive.
      Tracking doesn’t work well, however, in heavily traveled urban environments.

      In addition, you have the terrain stunt power.

      **Terrain stunt:** At the start of each battle in a non-urban environment, roll a d6.
      Any time after the escalation die reaches that number, you’ll be able to use a quick action to execute a terrain stunt.
      Normally you can only use terrain stunt once per battle, but circumstances, geography, or excellent planning may suggest that you can pull it off more than once.

      Terrain stunts are improvisational effects that play off your preternatural understanding of the wilderness and all the diverse forms of the natural world.
      Things like knocking a hornets nest no one had noticed onto your enemy’s head,
      maneuvering a foe onto a soggy patch of ground that slows them down,
      shooting the cap off a mushroom spore in a dungeon that erupts on your enemies,
      getting your enemy’s sword wedged into a stalactite,
      finding the tree branch that lets you vault up to attack the flying demon that thought it was out of axe range,
      and similar types of actions.
    feats:
      - tier: adventurer
        description: Your grasp of the way the world is put together increases; you now can use terrain stunt in urban environments.
      - tier: champion
        description: You can track as well in urban areas as you do in the wilderness.
      - tier: epic
        description: You can track flying creatures and creatures that normally wouldn’t be trackable, and there’s the possibility that even teleports give you a sense of direction.

## Animal Companion Rules

You have a devoted animal companion who fights alongside you like a member of your adventuring party.

### Recoveries

Add two recoveries to your total recoveries. You can use a recovery on yourself or your animal companion.

### Actions

Your animal companion acts on your initiative turn, either immediately before or after you, depending on the animal type.

Your animal companion moves gets a move action and a standard action, but not a quick action.

If you have powers that care about the 'first time you attack an enemy,' an attack by your animal companion counts as your attack.

### Animal Harm

Your animal companion can be healed like an ally.
If it gets healed without you being healed, it uses one of your recoveries. When you use a recovery while next to your animal companion (including being engaged with the same enemy), your animal companion is also healed using a free recovery.

Instead of dying like a monster or NPC at 0 hp, your animal companion follows PC rules for falling unconscious at 0 hp and dying after four failed death saves or when its negative hit points equal half its normal hit points.
If your animal companion dies, you can summon another one.
If you're still on the same adventure, you can call a new animal companion the next day, but it will be one level lower than an animal companion would normally be.
At the start of a new adventure, or when you gain a level, bump the companion up to its proper level.

### Stats &amp; Levels

Each animal companion has roughly the same base stats as listed below.

Your animal companion is always one level lower than you.
As a 1st level ranger, you'll have a level 0 animal companion.
Once you gain a level, your animal companion rises to 1st level.

On top of the base stats, each type of animal has a zoologically appropriate power or advantage.

### Companion Bonuses

Each type of animal companion is a little different.

<Vault.AbilityList

    "Bear",
    "Boar",
    "Eagle",
    "Panther",
    "Snake",
    "Wolf",
  ])}
/>

### Baseline Stats

Use the following stats as the baseline for your animal companion. Remember that your companion stays a level lower than you.
Generally your companion's Physical Defense should be higher than its Mental Defense, but you could flip that if you have a good explanation.

| Level | Attack     | Damage | AC  | PD (or MD) | MD (or PD) | HP        |
| ----- | ---------- | ------ | --- | ---------- | ---------- | --------- |
| 0     | +5 vs. AC  | d8     | 16  | 14         | 10         | 20 (10)   |
