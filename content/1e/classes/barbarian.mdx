## Class Features

All barbarians have the Barbarian Rage class feature.

<Vault.Ability name="Barbarian Rage" type="Class Feature">

**Effect:** Once per day, use a quick action to start raging.
A rage lasts until the end of battle, or about 5 minutes.

While raging, you roll 2d20 to hit with your barbarian melee and thrown weapon attacks instead of 1d20.
Use the higher roll for the attack.
If you roll a natural 11+ with both dice and your highest attack roll is a hit, the attack is a critical hit!

_Recharge 16+:_ After a battle in which you rage, roll a d20 and add your Constitution modifier.
On a 16+, you can use Barbarian Rage again later in the day.
