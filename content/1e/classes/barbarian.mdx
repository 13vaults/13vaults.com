  - name: Barbarian Rage
    _type: Class Feature
    description: |-
      **Effect:**
      Once per day, use a quick action to start raging.
      A rage lasts until the end of battle, or about 5 minutes.

      While raging, you roll 2d20 to hit with your barbarian melee and thrown weapon attacks instead of 1d20. Use the higher roll for the attack.
      If you roll a natural 11+ with both dice and your highest attack roll is a hit, the attack is a critical hit!

      _Recharge 16+:_
      After a battle in which you rage, roll a d20 and add your Constitution modifier.
      On a 16+, you can use Barbarian Rage again later in the day.
