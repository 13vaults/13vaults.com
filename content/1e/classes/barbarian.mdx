      That one is so different from anyone I've ever seen, with those rough clothes and weapons.
      You can tell he's from another world, living in a place where you have to fight every day just to survive.
      It makes you realize how sheltered we are in these city walls.

      **Effect:**
      Once per day, use a quick action to start raging.
      A rage lasts until the end of battle, or about 5 minutes.

      While raging, you roll 2d20 to hit with your barbarian melee and thrown weapon attacks instead of 1d20. Use the higher roll for the attack.
      If you roll a natural 11+ with both dice and your highest attack roll is a hit, the attack is a critical hit!

      _Recharge 16+:_
      After a battle in which you rage, roll a d20 and add your Constitution modifier.
      On a 16+, you can use Barbarian Rage again later in the day.

      true magic item bracers like a monk to improve your unarmed attacks.
  
  
      Once per battle, when you hit with an unarmed melee attack, you can declare a
      wrestling stunt. Choose one of the effects below:
  
  
      - The target is dazed: -4 to attacks; save ends.
  
      - Force the target off guard: -4 to AC and PD; save ends.
  
      - Choke (or twist) the target: deal 1d6 per level extra damage; this damage is
      not doubled on a critical hit.
  
      - Throw the target: normal size or smaller only; attacks against it have advantage
      until it takes a move action; you can choose to pop free from it.
  
      - Restrain the target: normal size or smaller only; the target has disadvantage
      on disengage checks and attack rolls (save ends); also ends when you or the target
      disengages. While restraining an enemy, the only attacks you can make are unarmed
      melee attacks against that target.
  
      - Hold on to the target (large or huge enemies only): when the target moves, you
      stay engaged with it even if it disengages from other combatants; it can shake
