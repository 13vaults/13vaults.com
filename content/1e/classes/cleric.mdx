      You gain 4 additional background points that must be used somehow in relation to knowledge or lore.

      **Invocation of Knowledge/Lore:** You must use this invocation during your first round of a battle.
      When you do, you get a quick glimpse of the battle's future.
      Roll a d6; as a free action at any point after the escalation die equals the number you rolled, you can allow one of your allies to reroll a single attack roll with a +2 bonus thanks to your vision of this future.

      Once per level, you can generate a one-point conflicted relationship with a heroic or ambiguous icon you do not already have a relationship with.
      The relationship point remains with you until you gain a level, and then it's time for another one-level relationship.

      **Invocation of Love/Beauty:** As a free action, at some dramatic moment, you or an ally of your choice can roll for one icon relationship that might have an effect on the battle.
      Rolls of 5 and 6 are beneficial as usual, though the GM will have to improvise what that means in the middle of combat.
      The invocation's advantage does not occur the moment you roll initiative; wait for a dramatic moment instead.

## Basic Attacks

<Vault.AbilityList
  abilities={props.getAbilities(["Melee Attack", "Ranged Attack"])}
/>

## Class Features

All clerics have the Ritual Magic class feature. They also receive a bonus spell: _heal_.

There are certain abilities specific to the cleric that can affect their powers:

- _Cast for power and cast for broad effect:_
  The spell can be used one of two ways—either as a more powerful effect on one target (power) or as a weaker effect on multiple targets (broad).
  Spells cast for power cannot target the caster.
  Spells cast for broad effect can.
- _Free recovery:_
  The cleric can recover hit points as if they were using a recovery (without actually spending the recovery).
- _Heal using a recovery:_
  The character targeted with a healing effect uses one of their recoveries and rolls their own recovery dice.
- _Invocation:_
  A quick action that offers advantages in battle.
  It can be made once a day.
  More than one cleric in a party cannot use the same invocation during a battle.
