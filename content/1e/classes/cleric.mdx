      Using the spell removes one of your spell slots until you gain a level.
      (You get one less spell per full heal-up.)
      The person you are resurrecting comes back at roughly half strength, e.g. expending half their recoveries, being dazed (save ends), and, for each ability, having a 50% chance that it is expended.

      The second time in your life you cast the spell, it takes at least three or four rounds and costs you roughly half your hit points and daily powers/spells.
      The person you are resurrecting comes back at something like one-quarter strength.

      The third time you cast the spell it has to be as a ritual.
      The spell chews you up and leaves you with only a few hit points, then gnaws at the person you have resurrected, who takes days to recover well enough to qualify as an adventurer or combatant.

      The fourth time you cast the spell it nearly kills you.
      The resurrection succeeds but the person you’ve resurrected is going to be a mess for a month or more, regardless of any other magic you use.

      The fifth time you resurrect someone, that’s the end of your story and you die.
      There’s only a 50% chance that the resurrection spell works on the target.
      You’ve used up your quota of resurrection magic. You’re not coming back via this spell, either.

      **Limited Resurrection:** If the target of your resurrection spell has been resurrected more times than you have cast the spell, there is a 50% chance that the experience will play out using their higher number of resurrections instead of the number of times you have cast the spell.

      That ally must take the reroll result.

      **Effect:**  You reset the target to zero hit points and zero failed death
      saves. The target starts making death saves, even outside of combat. If it fails
      four death saves, it is permanently dead. It cannot take recoveries or heal,
      even through magic, until it succeeds at a death save.
  
      Being raised from the dead is very strenuous. The target takes a -2 penalty to
      attack rolls, defenses, skill checks and saves until the next full heal-up.
  
      In addition, one randomly chosen ability score of the target is permanently
      reduced by 2, and it permanently loses a recovery. They also end up with a
      permanent quirk that is related to how they died. For example, if they died from
      a fireball, they might end up with permanent flame marks on their skin and a
      strong fear of fire.

      **Target:**  One nearby creature with 60 hp or fewer
  
      **Attack:**  Wisdom + Level vs. MD
  
      **Hit:**  The target sees you as a hapless damsel in distress that needs
      protection. On its turn, it won’t take any actions except move close to you, if
      possible. When adjacent to you, it has a 50% chance of taking a hit that was
      meant for you. Once between its turns, it can make a counterattack against a
      creature attacking you as an interrupt. The effect ends on a normal save, or if
      the target is attacked by you or one of your allies.

      an ally tries to harm it. If combat starts, the target can save against the

      **Effect:**  When the spell is cast, a good thing happens to the target through
      sheer dumb luck. Maybe they kick a stone down the dark tunnel to disarm a deadly

      just happen to recognize the shopkeeper as an old childhood friend to get a big
      discount.
  
      It’s best to cast the spell when there is a specific problem that the party is
      facing. The GM then decides what boon to grant the PC, and the player can
      narrate the details of what happens.

      **Effect:**  This spell provides you with an effective magical disguise that
      lasts about ten minutes, making the skill check to avoid unmasking one step
      easier (-5 to the difficulty). The spell only affects your general appearance,
      not your size. It can be used to hide your features behind the generic features
      of another person or race. Using it to impersonate a specific creature makes it
      less effective as a disguise (-2 to -5 penalty to the check).

      **Base spell:**  Sanctuary
  
      **Effect:**  You summon building materials and divine spirits that can erect a
      building of your choice overnight. A single casting of the ritual is enough for
      a one-storey building, a bridge over a stream, or a statue. For bigger projects,
      you need to cast the ritual multiple times, or find a way to increase the
      effect.

## Class Features

All clerics have the Ritual Magic class feature. They also receive a bonus spell: _heal_.

There are certain abilities specific to the cleric that can affect their powers:

- _Cast for power and cast for broad effect:_
  The spell can be used one of two ways—either as a more powerful effect on one target (power) or as a weaker effect on multiple targets (broad).
  Spells cast for power cannot target the caster.
  Spells cast for broad effect can.
- _Free recovery:_
  The cleric can recover hit points as if they were using a recovery (without actually spending the recovery).
- _Heal using a recovery:_
  The character targeted with a healing effect uses one of their recoveries and rolls their own recovery dice.
- _Invocation:_
  A quick action that offers advantages in battle.
  It can be made once a day.
  More than one cleric in a party cannot use the same invocation during a battle.
