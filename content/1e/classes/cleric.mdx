## Basic Attacks

<Vault.AbilityList
  abilities={props.getAbilities(["Melee Attack", "Ranged Attack"])}
/>

## Class Features

All clerics have the Ritual Magic class feature. They also receive a bonus spell: _heal_.

There are certain abilities specific to the cleric that can affect their powers:

- _Cast for power and cast for broad effect:_
  The spell can be used one of two ways—either as a more powerful effect on one target (power) or as a weaker effect on multiple targets (broad).
  Spells cast for power cannot target the caster.
  Spells cast for broad effect can.
- _Free recovery:_
  The cleric can recover hit points as if they were using a recovery (without actually spending the recovery).
- _Heal using a recovery:_
  The character targeted with a healing effect uses one of their recoveries and rolls their own recovery dice.
- _Invocation:_
  A quick action that offers advantages in battle.
  It can be made once a day.
  More than one cleric in a party cannot use the same invocation during a battle.
