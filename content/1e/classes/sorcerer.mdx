  - name: Breath Weapon
    _type: Class Feature
    description: |-
      Spells with the breath weapon keyword have a chance to be re-used during battle.
      Each breath weapon spell lists the chance of re-using it (usually 16+).
      At the start of each round after you’ve cast the breath weapon spell, make the re-use roll.
      Success indicates that you may re-use that spell as a standard action, but for that round only.
      If you fail the re-use roll, you don’t have the option to re-use the spell, but you get another chance at the beginning of the next round.

      The breath weapon power lasts for a single battle only.

      You can have only one breath weapon spell active at a time.
      If you cast a different breath weapon spell when you have an earlier spell active, the new spell cancels the earlier spell.
      (See the Chromatic Destroyer Heritage talent for the path to multiple breath weapon spells.)

      Failing a death save cancels any breath weapon spells you have active.

  - name: Dancing Lights
    version: Core Book
    _type: Class Feature
    description: |-
      All sorcerers can cast the dancing lights spell as a standard action.
      Unlike the wizard’s light cantrip, the sorcerer’s dancing lights spell produces a number of varicolored light globes that bloom within 5 to 30 feet of the sorcerer every two to five seconds.
      The sorcerer has very little control over the exact location or illumination provided by the lights, meaning that they can occasionally be used for dramatic plot purposes.
  - name: Gather Power
    _type: Class Feature
    description: |-
      Once initiative has been rolled and a battle is underway, a sorcerer can spend a standard action to gather magical power, preparing themselves for casting a double-strength spell with their next standard action.
      Gathering power is loud and very noticeable.

      Sorcerers who want to gather power before initiative has been rolled can go through the motions but won't get any benefit from the act.

      When a sorcerer gathers power, it does not count as casting a spell;
      you can gather power without taking opportunity attacks.

      In addition, because you spend your standard action to gather power, you generate a small magical benefit (see below).

      After you have gathered power, you can use your next standard action to cast an empowered sorcerer spell.
      Empowered sorcerer spells deal double the damage of a normal sorcerer spell.
      This means that you double the damage results of the hit or a miss from the single spell.
      Non-attack spells generally don't improve when cast empowered; use empowered casting for attacks.

      If you do not or are not able to use your next standard action to cast a sorcerer attack spell, you lose the power you've gathered.
      You can use another standard action to gather power again, but the spell you eventually cast will still only do double damage.

      You can spend your move actions and quick actions any way you like after you gather power and before casting your next empowered spell.
      Yes, once a battle has started it's possible to perform the magical firefight trick of gathering power while hiding to the side of the cave entrance, then jumping into the cave opening on your next turn and blasting with the empowered spell.

      Breath weapon spells add an extra wrinkle.
      Of course you can gather power the first time you cast a breath weapon spell in a battle.
      Later in the fight it's a question of whether you gathered power the turn before a breath weapon spell roll goes your way.
      You can be all ready with gathered power but roll too low to use the breath weapon spell, forcing you to cast a different spell with the gathered power.

      If you've gathered power for a spell that deals ongoing damage, the ongoing damage is doubled the first time it is dealt, but not on subsequent rounds, if any.

      7th level spell: You can now fly twice as fast as you normally move on the ground. You also gain a +5 bonus to disengage checks.

      The effect is entirely up to the GM, though the immediate impact of the spell should always be favorable for you.
      The long-term consequences of randomly invoking the power of an icon that may be an enemy might not be favorable for you,
      and should be played for narrative interest by the GM, particularly if the impact of the spell was huge for you.
      Since this is a daily spell, sizeable impact is fine, but don’t award any extra effect for empowered casting,

      **Effect:** Roll your relationship dice that you have with a sorcerous heroic icon.

      For each 6 you roll, you gain one 7th level or lower spell from any spellcasting class that you can cast this battle.
      For each 5 you roll, you gain one 5th level or lower spell from any spellcasting class that you can cast this battle.

      If the escalation die is 5+, you can swap the escalation die for one or your rolls.
      If you get no successes, you regain the spell after this battle.

      You can acquire one of the new spells the same round you cast this spell.
      Then select and acquire any other gained spells at the start of your next turn.

      You can use your Charisma as the ability score that provides the acquired spells’ attack bonuses and damage bonuses (if any).
      Other ability score references remain unchanged.

      As you might expect, each 5 you roll also invokes an icon-related complication or obligation in the tradition of rolling 5s on relationship checks.

      A sorcerer’s magic is an innate ability, and they can intuitively control it as
      if they were moving a hand or a finger. Each bloodline has metamagic tricks to
      improve their spells. Arcane sorcerers are great at targeting their spells,
      whereas draconic sorcerers have a few extra tricks with their breath weapons,
      and so on.
  
      To fuel these tricks, _Dark Alleys & Twisted Paths_ adds _sorcery points_ as a new resource for
      sorcerers. You have a pool of sorcery points equal to your Charisma modifier,
      and you regain all expended sorcery points after a full heal-up.
  
      To use a metamagic ability, you must declare that you spend sorcery points on a
      spell or roll _before_ rolling the dice, unless the description says otherwise.
      The benefit only applies to this casting of the spell. You can only augment a
      spell with one metamagic ability at a time.
  
      If you have gained a spell through your Access to … class feature, you can apply
      metamagic to them in the same way you augment your sorcerer spells.

      Alert, Flight, Scout, Tough, or Talkative abilities from the wizard list.
  
      **Celestial Ward:** Once per battle, when the Sorcerer, or an adjacent ally is
      attacked, give the attack a penalty equal to the escalation die.
  
      **Healing Touch:** Once per day, the familiar can touch an ally. The ally can use
      a recovery to heal.
  
      **Radiant:** Once per battle, when you hit an enemy engaged with you, you can add
      5 ongoing holy damage per tier to the damage roll.

      Celestial sorcerers can cast the _radiant halo_ spell as a standard action. The
      spell produces an intense, almost blinding light source that is centered around
      the top of your head. It bathes the area within 30 feet around you in a bright
      light which shines far past that distance. While the light provides perfect
      visibility as if under daylight conditions, and can even pierce dense fog, it
      makes attempts at stealth pretty much impossible.
  
      At the GM’s discretion, the halo can give creatures that are attuned to darkness
      (such as dark elves) a -1 penalty to attacks against you.
  
      The spell usually lasts at least an hour. You can cast it a number of times per
      day equal to your Charisma modifier.

      If you have the Sorcerer’s Familiar talent, you can choose

      with two abilities. One is Flight, the other is Breathe Fire
      for the pocket dragon and Prestidigitation for the pseudodragon.

      **Breathe Fire:** Once per battle, your familiar can make
      a Charisma + Level attack against a nearby opponent’s
      PD (using your Charisma modifier and level). On a hit,
      it deals 1d6 per level fire damage against the target, and
      half damage on a miss. You can change the damage type
      to match the dragon’s color.

      **Prestidigitation**: Your familiar can cast the wizard's
      Prestidigitation cantrip at-will.

      Some claim that the Shadow Prince controls a hidden source of magic, woven from
      the Shadows of our prime existence, and separated from the arcane magics that
      the dragons and the Archmage lord over.
  
      Other rumors say his power was stolen, and that the Lich King’s phylactery is
      hidden in the Shadow Prince’s vault. Followers of the Lich King don’t deny that,
      but they claim that it was stored there for safekeeping, or that the Lich King
      allowed it to be stolen, to keep it out of reach of more dangerous foes.
  
      What is known is that some children are born with the gifts of the Shadow
      Prince, able to embrace the darkness and manipulate the shadows.
  
      Umbral sorcerers often appear lifeless, with pale skin, milky white or raven
      black hair, and raspy, whispering voices. Some have a ghost-like appearance, as
      if they were not quite there.

      ### Umbral Familiars

      Your familiar is a creature associated with the dark arts, such as a cat, raven
      or a bat. Some are ghostly or skeletal in appearance. Your familiar has two
      abilities, which you can choose from Consume, Corrupting Touch, Ghost-sight or
      Insubstantial below, or Counter-bite, Flight, or Poisonous from the wizard list.
      If you choose a raven, it can also be Talkative.
  
      **Consume:** Once per day, when an attack would take you below zero hit points,
      you can consume your familiar as an interrupt. Immediately heal using a free
      recovery. Your familiar reforms at the next full heal-up.
  
      **Corrupting Touch:** Once per day, your familiar can make a Charisma + Level
      attack against the PD of an enemy you are engaged with. On a hit, the target is
      weakened until the end of your next turn.
  
      **Ghost-sight:** While your familiar is nearby, you can sense the presence of
      undead, even at far away range.
  
      **Insubstantial:** Your familiar can pass through solid objects, but it cannot
      interact with physical objects (like stealing items and such). If it takes
      damage, it just dissolves and reappears on your shoulder at the start of your
      next turn. It would take an exorcism or similar to destroy it.

      All Umbral sorcerers can cast the _crypt candles_ spell as a standard action.
      The spell produces a circle of black and red candles that provide an eerie
      illumination within thirty feet of youfeet you. They create enough light to move
      around, but it’s easy to miss details in the dim, flickering lights. If you
      move, the zone moves with you.
  
      The candles and their illumination can only be seen by you, your allies and any
      creatures with a connection to the Shadow Prince or the Lich King. They make
      invisible creatures visible.
  
      The spell usually lasts at least an hour. You can cast it a number of times per
      day equal to your Charisma modifier.

      Arcane scholars designate wild sorcery as a bloodline, but purely out of
      convenience. There does not seem to be a discernible pattern how, when, or why
      this magic ability manifests in humanoids. If anything, having an ancestor with
      any form of arcane ability seems to decrease your chances of being born with
      this gift. As with all bloodlines, wild magic also manifests in your physical
      features, but in a much less stable or predictable way. Don’t be surprised if
      you wake up with sky-blue fingernails and butterflies in your hair one morning;
      it’s all part of the gift.

      ### Wild Random Energy

      The wild bloodline’s “random energy” is a little more random than that of other
      sorcerers. You roll a d6 on the table, but this will only tell you who gets to
      describe what you just conjured. And yes, that means if that person considers
      strawberry jam or butterflies a valid element for the _13th Age Roleplaying
      Game_, that’s what your spell is blasting across the battlefield. It’s up to the
      GM to decide whether a particular creature is vulnerable or resistant to that
      “element” or not.

      | Roll (d6) | Who decides? |
      |---|---|
      | 1 | The player on your left |
      | 2 | You |
      | 3-4 | The GM |
      | 5 | The player who is newest to RPGs |
      | 6 | The player on your right |

      ### Wild Familiars
      Like _Core Book_ sorcerer familiars, wild familiars have one fixed ability, and
      two that are determined at random every day. In addition to the choices on the
      Wizard Familiar list, you have Wild Entropy as an option.
  
      **Wild Entropy:** Once per day, when you are hit by an attack while your familiar
      is next to you, your familiar’s magical influence can force the attacker to
      reroll the attack.

      _You’ve had many ancestors with the powers of your sorcerous bloodline. You may
      have even been bred for it. Or, you are a close descendant of an icon that is
      the source of sorcerous powers._
  
      You gain a bonus _bloodline spell_ slot, which you can use to spontaneously cast
      spells from your bloodline. You don’t choose the spell to cast in that slot
      after a full heal-up. Instead, you can use it to cast any spell from your
      bloodline, at the highest level you can cast. If the spell is a daily spell, the
      slot is expended until the next full heal-up (although in case of a breath
      spell, you still recharge it during the battle normally). If the spell has a
      recharge roll after battle, and you succeed on the roll, you regain the spell
      slot instead of the individual spell. If the spell is once per battle, you also
      regain the slot after the battle. In case of an at-will spell, you can cast it
      at-will that battle, and then regain the slot after the battle.
  
      This increased specialization comes at a cost, however, by limiting your overall
      spell choice. Choose two bloodlines in addition to your own bloodline. You can
      only cast sorcerer spells of these three bloodlines, as well as any spells
      gained through your Spell Access class feature. If a spell belongs to multiple
      bloodlines, you can cast it if you have access to one of them.

      attacks deal half damage.

      and vulnerable to fire and axes. All its damage is changed to poison damage.

## Bloodline

Your bloodline (_which you can pick at the top of this page_) customizes the Access to Wizardry, Gather Power
(chaotic benefit), Dancing Lights, and Random Energy class features of the Core
Book sorcerer. If you have a familiar, it also changes the available options.

In _Dark Alleys & Twisted Paths_, each sorcerer spell is now linked to one or more bloodlines.
You can still choose your sorcerer spells freely from any bloodline, but certain
effects and benefits will only trigger for spells from your bloodline. The
bloodlines presented in this book are:

| | |
|---|---|
| **Arcane Bloodline** |  Descendants of powerful wizards |
| **Celestial Bloodline** | Divine casters with angelic blood |
| **Draconic Bloodline** | The pure gift granted by dragons |
| **Fey Bloodline** | Progeny of fey creatures |
| **Infernal Bloodline** | The taint of the Abyss |
| **Storm Bloodline** | Infusion with raw elemental power |
| **Umbral Bloodline** |  Engulfed by the shadows of the Underworld |
| **Wild Magic** | Spontaneously manifested, untamed and chaotic forces |

Your selected bloodline is:

### About Heritage Talents

Sorcerers possess innate talent for magic that is impulsive and chaotic where wizardry is measured and studied.
Most sorcerers have strong magical links to one of the icons.
