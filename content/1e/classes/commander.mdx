      'You are the shield that protects us all,' I told him, my voice steady and resolute.
      'Remember your training, and trust in the strength of those beside you. We will stand together and face this darkness as one.'
      With renewed vigor, the soldier stood taller, his fear replaced by determination.
      It was in that moment, watching the tide of battle shift as the young soldier rallied his comrades, that I truly understood the power of leadership.
      It is not the strength of one's sword arm that carries the day, but the conviction in their heart, and the courage they inspire in others.

## Basic Attacks

<Vault.AbilityList
  abilities={props.getAbilitiesByType("Basic Attack")}
  columns={2}
/>

## Class Features

All commanders have class features associated with commands and tactics.

Commands allow you to help your allies fight better.
You issue them as interrupt actions during their turn. To issue a command, the ally must be conscious, but line of sight isn’t required.

All commands are at-will powers, though they do cost command points, and are usually limited to once per round (as an interrupt).
You start each battle with 1 command point and generally gain more via the two standard commander features: Fight from the Front and Weigh the Odds.
Excess command points go away at the end of the battle.

Your powers also include tactics that have immediate effect during your turn.
Tactics, as opposed to commands, don’t use command points.
You also don’t have to wait around for an ally’s turn to use them.
However, tactics don’t always recharge after a battle.

You can choose the commands and tactics you want to use.
A 1st-level commander starts with a total of 4 commands and tactics.
An effective commander should choose a good balance of commands and tactics.
