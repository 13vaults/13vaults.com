      Everyone knew of Haskell, but most thought it was just tales you tell children.
      That night, though, he slid in through a breach in the ceiling I never even knew was there, with the keys in hand.
      Didn't ask for anything, just opened the cell doors for everyone and fled in the shadows.
      What I don't know is why wasn't he a wanted man after after that?
      Everyone knows he did it, and "the Butcher" always hunts those that break order.
      Strange, really.

  - name: Momentum
    _type: Class Feature
    description: |-
      Many of the rogue’s powers function only when the rogue has momentum.

      You gain momentum by hitting an enemy with an attack.

      You lose momentum when you are hit by an attack.

      The default is that you can use momentum powers without losing momentum, but a few powers specify that you must spend your momentum to use them.
      You don’t have to use attacks that require momentum against the foe you hit to gain that momentum.

      Momentum powers that do not require you to spend your momentum are generally classified as interrupt actions.
      You can only use one interrupt action a round, which keeps your momentum powers from dominating the battle.
