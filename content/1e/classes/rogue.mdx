  - name: Momentum
    _type: Class Feature
    description: |-
      Many of the rogue’s powers function only when the rogue has momentum.

      You gain momentum by hitting an enemy with an attack.

      You lose momentum when you are hit by an attack.

      The default is that you can use momentum powers without losing momentum, but a few powers specify that you must spend your momentum to use them.
      You don’t have to use attacks that require momentum against the foe you hit to gain that momentum.

      Momentum powers that do not require you to spend your momentum are generally classified as interrupt actions.
      You can only use one interrupt action a round, which keeps your momentum powers from dominating the battle.

      Even rogues whose backgrounds don’t have anything to do with noticing, avoiding, or disarming traps have a unique knack for dealing with traps.

      If a rogue’s skill check involving a trap is a natural even failure, the rogue can reroll the skill check once.
      If a trap’s attack roll against a rogue is a natural odd roll, the rogue can force the trap to reroll the attack once.

      **Attack:** Charisma + Level vs. MD

      **Hit:** Remove yourself from play.
      At the start of your next turn, return anywhere nearby that you could have moved to normally during your turn, and deal double damage with your first rogue attack that turn.

      **Miss:** No effect. You can’t attempt to shadow walk again until your next turn, but you still have your standard action this turn.

      Once per day, convince your GM with an amazing line of patter while you are using social skills to speak or interact with NPCs associated with a particular icon.
      If the GM is convinced by your patter, roll a normal save (11+).
      If you succeed, for the rest of the day you can function as if you have a 2-point positive relationship with the icon who seems to be in play.
      Thanks to your amazing gift of gab, for a short time, it’s more or less true. (Note that these points replace any points you normally have with the icon rather than adding to them.)

      Failure on the Smooth Talk save generally arouses suspicions.

    description: |-
      Once per battle as a quick action, you can spend your momentum to pull off a daring stunt the likes of which others could scarcely conceive.
      You may make an attack as part of the stunt, but you’ll need to roll normally for the attack.

        description:
          Twice per level, you can steal something with a successful thief’s strike that you would not be able to steal ordinarily, but that would require a bit of magic, e.g. a dream, a spell, someone’s hope, a memory.
          The theft won’t be permanent.
          Every day, roll a hard save to determine whether you can keep what you stole for that day.
          Also, you can never steal the same thing twice.
