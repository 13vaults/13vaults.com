## Class Features

### Frenzy Dice

With each hit you score in a battle, you build up a pool of frenzy dice.
You add these dice to damage, but you can also expend them to fuel your powers or heal yourself.

You start each battle with zero frenzy dice.
Whenever you hit with a melee attack or a thrown weapon ranged attack, you gain frenzy dice at the end of that turn.
Only the first hit counts, multiple hits in one turn still only grant you frenzy dice once.
At first level, you gain a single <Vault.Dice>d4</Vault.Dice>.
The die increases by one step each level, as per the level progression table.
At 5th level, you gain two dice, and at 8th level, four.

The frenzy dice you gain are added to your frenzy pool.
You can keep adding frenzy dice until you reach the maximum, which is three times the dice you gain per hit.

When an attack or power uses your current frenzy dice, the pool is referred to as FRENZY (similar to WEAPON for your weapon damage dice).
Most importantly, you add FRENZY to damage when you hit with a basic melee attack.
Using FRENZY does not expend the dice; they remain in your pool.
However, there are two uses that expend your frenzy dice.
One is to pay the cost of your frenzy powers, the other is your frenzied healing class feature below.
