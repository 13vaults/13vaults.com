      Isadora lacks the precision and control of the arcane like that of I, and as a result, she often causes more harm than good.

    _type: Class Feature
    description: |-
      Every wizard can cast a handful of cantrips each day.
      You don’t have to memorize or choose them beforehand, you just cast them on the fly.

      Wizards can cast a number of cantrips equal to their Intelligence modifier each battle.
      Each cantrip takes a standard action to cast as a ranged spell.
      Outside of battle, a wizard can cast about three to six cantrips every five minutes.
      The Cantrip Mastery talent speeds up cantrip casting.

      At the adventurer tier (levels 1–4), cantrips with a standard duration last 10–60 minutes, plus 10 minutes per wizard level.
      The GM rolls and the wizard becomes aware that their cantrip is about to end a couple minutes before it’s done.

      At the champion tier, levels 5–7, most cantrips last 1–6 hours.

      At the epic tier, levels 8–10, cantrips last between 2–12 hours.

      For a list of available cantrips, see Cantrips.
  - name: Cyclic Spells
    _type: Class Feature
    description: |-
      Spells that have a cyclic usage can always be cast at least once per battle, and are only expended in that battle if they are cast when the escalation die is 0 or odd.
      In other words, if you cast a cyclic spell like color spray or rebuke when the escalation die is even, the spell is not expended and can still be cast later in the battle.

  - name: Cantrip Mastery
    _type: Talent
    description: |-
      Cantrips are at-will spells for you.

      Unlike normal wizards, who use a standard action to cast a cantrip, you can cast a cantrip as a quick action.

      To do something particularly cunning or surprising with one of your cantrips where the GM isn’t sure whether you could pull off that use of the spell, roll a normal save (11+) to cast the spell the way you envision it.

      Additionally, you can expend a 3rd level spell slot or higher to choose one cantrip per spell slot you have given up and create a once-per-day related effect with it that is much greater, if you and your GM can agree on a cool effect that suits the cantrip.

      The Cantrip Mastery talent is more about enhance the roleplaying and less about combat usefulness.
    feats:
      - tier: adventurer
        description: You can use cantrip-style versions of any wizard spell you have memorized. When you expend a spell, however, you can’t make cantrip-style use of it any more.The key is that none of these uses should be combat relevant or deal damage.

      Your study of the highest orders of magic gives you options that lesser wizards cannot match: Memorization and a bonus spell: counter-magic

      ### Memorization

      When you pick your spells, you can choose any daily wizard spell twice (instead of once). This doesn’t apply to spells that start as recharge spells.
      For example, at 7th level when you have five 7th level spells and four 5th level spells, you could choose fireball twice as a 7th level spell, or once as a 7th level spell and once as a 5th level spell.
      (Your 3rd level spell slot can’t be used for fireball because fireball starts as a 5th level spell.)

      ### Counter-magic

      Close-quarters spell

      Once per battle

      Free action to cast

      ---

      **Trigger:** A nearby creature you can see casts a spell.

      **Target:** The nearby creature casting a spell.

      **Attack:** Intelligence + Level vs. MD

      **Hit:** The target’s spell is canceled, and the caster loses the action they were using for the spell. If the spell had a limited use, that use is expended if your natural attack roll is even.
    feats:
      - tier: champion
        description: You can now cast counter-magic twice per battle.
      - tier: epic
        description: You can now cast counter-magic in reaction to a creature using any magical ability, not just casting a spell.

      Rename each of your daily and recharge spells. Think up the most over-the-top and extravagant names you can muster.
      Since these alternate spells are so lengthy, they take an additional quick action to cast. While the regular effects of the spells are the same as the more common versions, they have a small bonus effect appropriate to the situation.

      The bonus effect is determined by the GM, or by a collaboration between the GM and the player. It should add to the storytelling power of the situation.

      The bonus effect should suit the name of the spell or the way it’s delivered, and shouldn’t precisely match up with what the spell normally accomplishes.
  - name: Wizard's Familiar
    _type: Talent
    description: |-
      Your familiar is a tiny or small animal or creature that aids your magic and provides companionship. It also provides opportunities for improvisation between you and the GM.

      Your familiar is as intelligent as a normal person. It can communicate with you and will stay close you unless you’ve chosen abilities that let it roam. Your familiar is on your side but it’s not perfectly in your control.

      If your familiar dies, it can come back to you the next time you get a full heal-up. (The method or story used is between you and the GM.) Alternatively, you can get a new familiar.

      Familiars are useless in combat, except as indicated by their abilities. Ordinarily they aren’t damaged by enemy attacks and spells unless the story calls for it.

      ### Familiar Abilities

      Choose two of the following abilities for your familiar.

      #### Agile

      You gain a +2 bonus to Dexterity skill checks.

      #### Alert, Maybe Even Insightful

      You gain a +2 bonus to Wisdom skill checks.

      #### Counter-bite

      Each battle, if your familiar is close to you, it bites the first enemy that hits you with a melee attack after that attack, dealing 1d4 damage per level (no attack roll) to that enemy.

      #### Flight

      Your familiar flies as well as a hawk. It doesn’t fly that often and usually sticks with you, but it can do so when its other abilities allow.

      #### Mimic

      One battle per day, you gain the use of the racial power (without feats) of one nearby ally.

      #### Poisonous

      Once per battle, when you hit an enemy engaged with you, you can add 5 ongoing poison damage per tier to the damage roll.

      #### Scout

      Once per day, your familiar can separate itself from you and make a reconnaissance run of an area or location. Roll an easy skill check for the environment to get your familiar to scout unseen.

      #### Tough

      You gain a +1 save bonus. Tough counts as two familiar abilities.

      #### Talkative

      Your familiar can talk like a person (but the GM speaks for the familiar more than you do).

      - tier: champion

    usage: per-day
    description: |-
      **Range:** Close-quarters spell

      Daily

      ---

      **Effect:** This spell provides you with an effective magical disguise that lasts about ten minutes, making the skill check to avoid unmasking one step easier:
      easy if it would have been a normal task, normal if it would have been a hard task, and hard if it would have been a ridiculously hard task.
      The spell only affects your general appearance, not your size.
      It can be used to hide your features behind the generic features of another person or race. Using it to impersonate a specific creature makes it less effective as a disguise (-2 to -5 penalty).

      3rd level spell: The spell lasts for 1 hour.

      5th level spell: The spell also provides smell; +2 bonus to any checks.

      7th level spell: The spell also handles correct-sounding vocal patterns and rough mannerisms; +4 bonus to any checks.

      9th level spell: You can now target an ally with the spell; you can also now use it on up to two creatures at once.

      ---

      **Effect:** When you cast this spell, it arrests your fall, letting you glide down the ground over a round or two.

      3rd level spell: You can now target a nearby ally with the spell.

      5th level spell: You can now target up to two nearby creatures with the spell.

      7th level spell: You can now target up to five nearby creatures with the spell.

      9th level spell: You gain some control over where a target falls, like a quickly gliding feather.

    description: |-
      Ranged spell; Daily;

      ---

      **Effect:** You cast this spell on a door. For ten minutes, adventurer-tier creatures can’t get through the door.
      Champion-tier creatures can batter it down; each attempt requires a DC 20 Intelligence skill check (including an applicable background) by the caster to resist the battering and keep the spell going.
      Epic-tier creatures can walk right through.

      3rd level spell: The spell now lasts for an hour.
      Adventurer-tier creatures are stymied.
      Champion-tier creatures can batter the door down or destroy it after three failed DC 20 skill checks by the spellcaster. Epic creatures notice that the now-busted door had magic on it.

      5th level spell: Champion-tier creatures take a few minutes to force the door open. Epic creatures can force it open after one failed DC 25 skill check by the spellcaster.

      7th level spell: Champion-tier creatures are stymied for up to an hour by the door. Epic tier creatures get through after three failed DC 25 skill checks by the spellcaster.

      9th level spell: Champion-tier creatures can’t enter. Epic-tier creatures can’t get through for an hour.

      Ranged spell

      Daily

      ---

      **Effect:** Until the end of the battle, you can use a move action to rise straight up into the air or descend straight down. The spell itself won’t move you horizontally.
      The up-or-down movement is about half as fast as your normal movement. While levitating, you take a –2 penalty to your attacks and are vulnerable to attacks against you.

      5th level spell: You can now cast the spell on a nearby willing ally instead of yourself.

      7th level spell: You can now cast the spell as a quick action, and the spell can now affect two targets.

      9th level spell: The spell can now affect five targets.

      **Range:** Close-quarters spell

      Daily

      Quick action to cast

      ---

      **Effect:** You send a one to two sentence message to another person you know and have touched in the last week. Sending a message to a person you can see is always easy.
      Sending a message to a person you can’t see requires a skill check using Intelligence against the highest-tier environment that you or the sender are occupying.

      The maximum distance you can send a message depends on the spell’s level.

      3rd level spell: Across half a city, at most.

      5th level spell: Across the entire city and a bit into the countryside.

      7th level spell: Between cities near to each other.

      9th level spell: From any city to any other city, or across a sea.

      Quick action to cast

      **Effect:** Speak briefly, mind-to-mind, with a magic item you are touching that is owned by you or one of your allies. The item’s owner gets a free power recharge roll if that item’s power has been expended.

      5th level spell: You no longer need to be touching the item; it only has to be nearby.

      7th level spell: The item’s owner gains a +2 bonus to the item recharge roll.

      9th level spell: If the item recharge roll fails, you keep this spell, but the item won’t talk to you until after your next full heal-up.

      **Effect:** You can breathe underwater for the rest of the battle (or about five minutes). You become aware a couple of rounds ahead of when the magic of the spell is about to end.

      7th level spell: You and 1d4 + 2 nearby allies can breathe underwater this battle.

      9th level spell: The spell affects you and 1d6 + 2 nearby allies for 4d6 hours.
  - name: Scrying
    _type: Utility Spell 7
    school: Divination
    usage: per-day
    description: |-
      Ranged spell; Daily

      ---

      **Effect:** You can use this spell to get information you shouldn’t be able to get, peering in on other people’s lives for a short period of time, usually no more than ten minutes at a time.
      Some areas may be warded at the GM’s discretion. You must have touched the person you wish to spy on in the last month, or, at 9th level, within the last a year.

      Scrying as a single standard action won’t yield much. Concentrating on the spell for a while with props like a scrying pool or a crystal ball will work better.

      **Special:** This spell cannot be cast during combat or on a target that has rolled initiative to fight.

      **Attack:** Intelligence + Level vs. MD

      **Hit:** The target believes you are their friend until you or your allies take hostile action against them. (Attacking their normal allies is okay.)
      If you or your allies attack the target or order the target to attack its normal allies, the target can roll a normal save to break the charm effect during its turn each round.

      **Special:** On a miss, the spell is not detectible by most others unless you miss by 4+ or roll a natural 1, in which case the target and its allies knows what you tried to do and will usually be angry about it.

      Cloud spells create a fog in the nearby area. These spells usually attack a
      number of nearby enemies and have some effect on allies engaged with these
      targets.
  
      After the fog is created, non-engaged creatures can move out of it as a move
      action. Engaged creatures must succeed at a disengage check to do so.
  
      At the start of your next turn after casting the spell, make a normal save (11+)
      to check whether the cloud persists. This is not an action. If it persists, any
      target that was hit and is still in the cloud suffers the effect again, and you
      make another save at the start of the following turn. If the save fails, the
      spell ends.
  
      At the GM’s discretion, clouds move naturally with the terrain. They will roll
      down slopes and disperse in strong winds.

      When you choose spells during a full heal-up, you can declare one (and only one)
      of your spell slots as your specialist school slot. You don’t choose a spell for
      that slot after the full heal-up, but at the time of casting the spell. You can
      choose any normal spell or utility spell that belongs to your specialist school.
  
      If the spell you cast is a recharge spell, make a recharge roll at the end of
      the battle to regain the spell slot, not the particular spell. If the spell you
      cast is once per battle, cyclic, or at-will, you cast the spell normally during
      the battle, then regain the spell slot at the end of the battle.
  
      **This replaces access to the Core Book wizard’s utility spell slot.
      You can still cast utility spells, but you prepare them individually like your

      normal-difficulty skill check.

      **Effect:**  Inscribe any spell you have prepared for the day onto a parchment.
      You can cast the spell from the scroll once at a later date, which uses up the
      scroll.
  
      Choose the level of the spell when you create the scroll, between the lowest
      level it can be learned at and the highest you can cast.
  
      Creating a scroll takes roughly 10 minutes per spell level and expends your use
      of that spell for the day, even for spells other than daily spells. It requires
      material components that cost about 50 gp per level of the spell.
  
      The finished scroll can be used by others, but doing so requires an
      Intelligence-based skill check with a DC of 15 + the spell’s level (10 + level
      for other wizards). On a natural even failure, nothing happens, but on a natural
      odd failure, the magic gets triggered in an unintended, possibly disastrous way,
      and the scroll is destroyed.

      minutes of concentration are enough to gain an understanding of its contents. A
      full day is required if you want to achieve a word-by-word memorization. You

      specified by you. The message is entirely mundane and cannot create spell
      effects. The event that triggers the message can be as simple or as complicated
      as you like, but the conditions are limited to what can be perceived by normal
      means. No mind reading, detecting invisible creatures and the like. The spell
      remains in effect for one day per spell level.

      information. The eye floats at walking speed, and you can send it out of your
      line of sight. Through the eye, you can see as if through your own eyes. It
      cannot pass through walls, but it can pass through small holes and openings. The
      eye persists for 1d6 x 10 minutes.
  
      During combat, it’s a quick action to direct the eye and receive visual imagery.
      If you don’t use the quick action, the eye remains inert.

      place, or item. Examples include a current or former icon, their stronghold, or
      a major artifact. The closer you are physically to the target, the more
      information can be gained by the spell. If you are in the target location, or
      have the object within reach, the spell is likely to provide vivid imagery of
      key scenes in its history. If the target is far away, or just a myth that may
      not be real at all, the spell will conjure just very hazy fragments of
      information.

      extensive animated illusion that affects all senses. The illusion cannot create
      solid objects, so if for example you create an illusory wall where there is
      none, anyone can just walk through it. Make a Charisma-based skill check to
      determine the quality of the illusion. Anyone with an MD higher than the check
      will see through it immediately. Others can save against the effect if they have
      a reason to disbelieve the illusion.
  
      The illusion lasts for a day but can be cast as a ritual for longer durations.

      images and sounds are entirely up to you. The screen stays up for 8 hours, but

      For a creature that has more than one natural form, such as a werewolf, you see
      both forms as a shadowy overlay. The target can also perceive things that are
      hidden away on other planes where they overlap with their current location.

      **Special:**  You can only cast this spell outside of battle; it requires 2d4
      minutes to cast.
  
      **Target:**  A suit of heavy armor
  
      **Effect:**  You animate a suit of heavy armor to fight for you as an armor
      golem, following to the summoning rules. The armor stays animated until it is
      reduced to zero hit points, or until your next full heal-up. The spell ends, but
      the armor is not destroyed when it is reduced it to zero hp (unless it makes
      sense story-wise, e.g. when falling into lava).
  
      By default, the armor uses its gauntlets to attack, and has a d4 damage die with
      them. However, the armor can also wield melee weapons like a fighter (with the
      same WEAPON damage dice) and use a shield for +1 AC.
  
      If you cast the spell on a true magic item suit of armor, or equip it with magic
      items, it benefits from their bonuses and abilities. However, it can only
      benefit from one item per spell level, and it suffers all item quirks.
  
      While the armor provides strong protection, it has one weakness — when it takes
      damage, it needs a round to reassemble itself, and cannot attack that turn.

      **Target:**  One nearby enemy
  
      **Attack:**  Intelligence + Level vs. MD
  
      **Hit:**  You plant a phantasm in the target’s mind that it considers to be real
      (save ends). Describe the phantasm to the GM, who will adjudicate the effect and
      the target’s actions. Some outcomes the GM can choose are:
  
      - Silly distraction: The target is dazed.
      - Overwhelming desire: The target will move toward a place, creature, or item,
      and possibly try to grab or touch it.
      - Stationary danger: The target will avoid a certain area.
      - Looming threat: The target will try to move away from a place or a creature as
      fast as it can.
      - Frightening horror: The target curls up in a corner, unable to do anything but
      shiver.
      - Imaginary pain: The target takes 10 ongoing psychic damage per spell level.
  
  
      The GM can set the save as hard (16+) or easy (6+) depending on how realistic
      the phantasm is in the current situation. The spell ends immediately if the
      target feels pain that is inconsistent with the phantasm (like touching a hot
      coal that it thought was a diamond). The target can still perceive everything
      outside of the phantasm normally. The phantasm cannot be seen by anyone else.
  
      **Miss:**  You regain the spell at the end of the battle.
  
      5th level spell: The phantasm can have up to two of the effects above.
  
      9th level spell: You can target a second enemy.

      **Target:**  You
  
      **Effect:**  Choose a spell of 5th level or lower that you can cast, and that
      can target you. You cast that spell—called the contingent spell—as part of
      casting contingency, expending spell slots for both, but the contingent spell
      doesn’t come into effect. Instead, it takes effect when a certain circumstance
      occurs. You describe that circumstance when you cast the two spells. For
      example, you could set a contingency to trigger water breathing when you are
      drowning.
  
      Triggering the contingent spell does not take an action from you. It takes
      effect immediately after the circumstance is met for the first time, whether or
      not you want it to, and then contingency ends.

      **Effect:**  You summon a fantastic beast (below), as per the summoning rules.
      The beast fights for you until the end of the battle, or until it drops to 0 hp,
      whichever comes first. Choose one special ability for the beast from the list
      below.
  
      _Memory Jumble:_ When the beast’s attack roll is a natural 20, the target is
      confused until the end of their next turn.
  
      _Oscillating Skin Pattern:_ Enemies engaged with the beast have disadvantage on
      attacks against targets other than the beast.
  
      _Phasing:_ If the escalation die is even, the beast can teleport to a nearby
      location you can see as a quick action.
  
      _Psychic Strike:_ When a nearby enemy attacks the beast’s MD, it can make a
      phantom claw attack against it as an interrupt action.

      **Attack:**  Intelligence + Level vs. PD
  
      **Hit:**  A sphere of shimmering force encloses the target (hard save 16+ ends).
      Nothing—not physical objects, energy, or other spell effects—can pass through
      the barrier, in or out. The sphere is immune to all damage, and a creature or
      object inside can’t be damaged by attacks or effects originating from outside,

      **Target:**  You or a nearby ally
  
      **Effect:**  You create a shimmering zone around the target that suppresses all
      magic within it. The zone protects the target and any creature next to it.
      Creatures within the zone can’t cast spells or use magic items, and any ongoing
      magical effects end. Magical attacks, including supernatural effects like gaze
      or breath weapons, don’t affect targets within the zone.
  
      The spell lasts until the end of the battle, or until you end it as a free
      action.

      **Special** : When you cast this spell, you can choose to cast it recklessly.
  
      **Target** : 1d3 + 1 nearby enemies in a group. If you cast recklessly, you can
      target 1d2 additional enemies, but then your allies engaged with any of the
      targets may also take damage (see below).
  
      **Attack** : Intelligence + Level vs. PD
  
      **Hit** : 2d4 x 10 damage.
  
      **Miss** : Half damage.
  
      **Reckless miss** : Your allies engaged with the target take one-fourth damage.
  
      9th level spell: 2d8 x 10 damage, and gravity remains reversed for any hit
      targets (as well as any damaged allies on a reckless miss) for a number of
      rounds equal to the current escalation die value when you cast the spell. If
      there’s no ceiling in the place where you cast this, multiply the base damage by
      the number f rounds the effect lasts—that’s how much they’ll take when they
      finally land.

      **Target:**  One nearby creature
  
      **Effect:**  You create an illusory double of the creature that fights for you
      until the end of the battle, according to the summoning rules. The simulacrum
      has the stats of the target, with the following changes:
  
      - It only has 45 hit points.
      - It ignores any attack against it with a natural odd attack roll.
      - If the target was double-strength, the simulacrum deals half damage. If it was
      triple-strength or a PC, the simulacrum deals one third of the damage. You
      cannot create a simulacrum of creatures stronger than triple-strength.
      - It can’t be healed.
  
  
      9th level spell: The simulacrum has 70 hp.

      **Effect:**  You create a glowing symbol on a nearby object that you imbue with
      a variable effect from the list below. You can choose between a lesser symbol,
      which has a weaker effect but affects more targets, or a greater symbol, which
      has a stronger effect but only affects one target.
  
      **Lesser Symbols**
  
      _Fear:_ The targets are struck by fear (-4 to attacks and can’t use the
      escalation die; save ends).
  
      _Hopelessness:_ The targets are struck by hopelessness (-5 to MD and -5
      difficulty to skill checks to give suggestions or commands to the target; save
      ends).
  
      _Pain:_ The target has disadvantage on attacks (save ends).
  
      _Discord:_ The targets are confused until the end of their next turn.
  
      _Persuasion:_ The targets are subject to a suggestion by the caster (save ends).
      The effect also ends if the target takes damage.
  
      **Greater Symbols**
  
      _Insanity:_ The target is confused (save ends).
  
      _Sleep:_ The target falls unconscious (save ends). The effect also ends if the
      target takes damage.
  
      _Stun:_ The target is stunned (save ends).
  
      _Death:_ The target starts making last gasp saves (16+). If it fails the fourth
      save, it dies.
  
      The symbol lasts until it is activated, or until 24 hours have passed. You also
      set an activation trigger, for example when the object is touched, when an
      undead creature comes near it, or when someone passes through the doorway under
      it.
  
      When the symbol is triggered, it makes the following attack:
  
      **Target (lesser symbol):**  the 1d4 closest creatures with 120 hp or fewer
  
      **Target (greater symbol):**  the closest creature with 180 hp or fewer
  
      **Attack:**  Intelligence + Level vs. MD
  
      **Hit:**  As per the chosen symbol
  
      9th level spell: Increase the hp threshold to 180 / 270 hp.

         You can hide the symbol, so that it only becomes visible on a certain condition
        (for example, when an orc approaches within 30 feet, or when someone is touching
        the object). The symbol must become visible before it can trigger.

         The effect skips nearby enemies with more hit points than the hp threshold if

      **Effect:**  You create a transparent wall in a straight line across the
      battlefield. The wall can be a few hundred feet across. The wall blocks
      creatures, attacks, and spells.
  
      When damage is dealt directly to the wall, divide the damage of that attack by
      10 and roll a d20. If the die roll is lower, the wall dissipates.
  
      9th level spell: The wall now only dissipates on the third failed roll.

      **Target:**  One nearby creature
  
      **Attack:**  Intelligence + Level vs. MD
  
      **Hit:**  You take complete control over the target (normal save 11+ ends;
      double-strength and stronger monsters make an easy save 6+). The target acts on
      its normal turn, but you determine its actions. If you order the target to do
      something that goes against its very nature, it can immediately save against the
      effect.

      **Target:**  One nearby creature
  
      **Attack:**  Intelligence + Level vs. MD
  
      **Hit:**  The target is reduced to minimal intelligence and instinctual behavior
      (hard save 16+ ends). The target can still physically defend itself and fight,
      and it recognizes friend from foe, but it can’t speak, cast spells, or use any
      advanced tactics. This is effectively a stronger version of the hampered
      condition.
  
      **Miss:**  The target is dazed until the end of your next turn.

      **Target:**  You or a nearby ally
  
      **Effect:**  The target rolls two d12s and keeps the higher result. As a free
      action, it can reduce the die by one to gain a sudden insight about an upcoming
      task, which grants advantage to a skill check, attack, or save. The target can
      also reduce the die by one to avoid being surprised, or impose disadvantage on
      an attack against it. The spell ends when the die is reduced to zero, or at the
      next full heal-up.

      **Hit:**  You shrink the target and teleport it into a gem, necklace or similar
      object. The target is fully conscious, but can’t escape the gemstone unless it
      succeeds at a hard save (16+), the gem is smashed, or it has a way to teleport
      out of there.
  
      **Miss:**  The target is teleported to a random nearby location.

      according to the summoning rules. The golem stays animated until it is reduced
      to zero hit points, or until your next full heal-up.

      labyrinth-like demiplane, where it has to search for the exit. At the end of
      each turn, it makes a normal save (11+). If it succeeds, it immediately rolls
      another save that turn, otherwise it starts saving again at the end of its next
      turn. It needs three successes to escape from the maze. Enemies whose MD is
      higher than yours only need two successes. Minotaurs always succeed at their
      save against this spell.

      **Hit:**  Roll 1d8 to determine which color ray affects the target.
  
      1. Red. The target takes 2d8 x 10 ongoing fire damage. 
      2. Orange. The target takes 3d8 x 10 acid damage.
      3. Yellow. The target takes 3d8 x 10 lightning damage.
      4. Green. The target takes 2d8 x 10 ongoing poison damage. If it fails a save
      while it has 150 hp or fewer, it dies.
      5. Blue. The target takes 3d8 x 10 cold damage.
      6. Indigo. The target is hampered (save ends). After the third failed save, it
      is permanently turned into stone.
      7. Violet. The target is blinded (treat as weakened, -4 to attacks and
      defenses). If it fails its save three times, it is transported to another plane
      of existence of the GM’s choosing. (Typically, a creature that is on a plane
      that isn’t its home plane is banished home, while other creatures are usually
      cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.) 
      8. The target is struck by two rays. Roll twice more, rerolling any 8s.
  
  
      **Miss:**  Roll 1d8 to determine the ray color, but the target takes half damage
      and ignores any non-damage effect.

      **Effect:**  Nearby enemies have disadvantage on magic and spell attacks
      (anything that can be targeted by Counterspell). If they try to cast a spell
      that does not involve an attack roll, roll a d20; if the roll is a natural 1–5,
      the spell fails. The effect lasts until the end of the battle, until you fall
      unconscious, or until an enemy rolls a natural 20 on a spell attack roll or
      spell failure check.

      **Effect:**  Time seems to cease flowing for everyone but you. You speed up so
      greatly that all other creatures seem frozen to you, although they are still
      moving at their normal speeds. You can take 1d4+1 full turns (standard action,
      move action, quick action) as a free action. You suffer effects like ongoing
      damage normally while taking these turns. While the time stop is in effect,
      other creatures are invulnerable to your attacks and spells. You cannot move or
      harm items held, carried, or worn by a creature stuck in normal time, but you
      can affect any item that is not in another creature’s possession. Any spell with
      a duration longer than the remaining duration of the time stop has its normal
      effects on other creatures once the time stop ends.

      **Target:**  One nearby enemy with 750 hp or fewer
  
      **Attack:**  Intelligence + Level vs. MD
  
      **Hit:**  The target is confused (save ends). It takes a penalty to the save
      equal to the escalation die. Whenever the target hits its own ally, it takes
      psychic damage equal to half the damage it dealt. Whenever the target takes
      damage, increase the damage of its attacks by its level until the end of the
      battle (even after the spell ends).

      **Effect:**  You utter the words “I wish …”, and the literal wording of that
      Wish becomes reality. Wish is the ultimate freeform spell, as it can make
      anything happen. It can heal wounds, transport you anywhere, summon items, and
      make bad things happen to your enemies. However, the universe has a way to
      reflect overly ambitious Wishes back at the caster, by giving them exactly what
      they wanted.
  
      **Special:**  You cannot, or rather should not attempt to cast this spell more
      than three times in a lifetime. Stories are vague as to the reason, but the most
      common legend is that the genie who fulfills your wishes is freed after the
      third casting, and a fourth attempt will force the caster to take their place.
  
      _GM Note:_ If you are looking for a literary inspiration for this spell, think
      about Cinderella’s transformation to join the ball. Think about who fulfills
      wishes in your campaign — Faerie godmothers? Genies? The Diabolist?
  
      All in all, treat this spell as a plot device. Fulfill the Wish in a way that
      moves the story forward, with an epic effect that is worthy of a 9th level
      spell, just like you would handle a 5 or 6 on an icon relationship roll. This is
      the most powerful spell in the game, cast by one of the most powerful casters in
      the game world, at the peak of the campaign. The results can and should feel
      amazing. There is always room to introduce unintended negative consequences
      later.

## Cantrips

### Alarm (standard duration)

The cantrip creates a minor watch-sprite that can be instructed to scream if someone comes through an area or touches an object.
Watch-sprites are notoriously stupid and sleepy, but with the right talking-to they might stay focused for the duration of the spell.
At higher levels, the spell might summon little fanged spirits buzzing back and forth serving as both visual and actual deterrents.

### Arcane Mark (standard duration)

The cantrip creates a magical sigil on an object or person.
These sigils are usually plain to see, though a deliberately invisible mark can be made.
It takes a difficult perception or magic check to notice.

### Ghost Sound

This spell creates false noises emanating from somewhere nearby.
The effect is like an exceptionally good version of throwing your voice, if your voice could create a wide variety of sounds.
Attempted distractions with the cantrip are DC 15 challenges in adventurer environments, higher as you move into champion and epic environments.
If someone is using ghost sound against the PCs, a Wisdom-based skill check can identify the sound as a magical fake.

### Knock

This cantrip summons a magical servitor three to four times as big as your closed fist that swarms around the door and attempts to punch or push it open (depending on whether you want to be quiet or announce your presence).
Success is determined with an Intelligence check against the environment's DC using an appropriate magical background.
This cantrip does nothing to avoid any traps that might exist.

### Light (standard duration)

This cantrip creates a fairly wide and consistent field of light, up to 30 feet in diameter, though it isn't bright enough to dazzle.

### Mage Hand

This cantrip creates a small telekinetic effect that lasts a round at most.
At best it's about half as strong as the wizard's own strongest hand.
At worst it's half as strong as the wizard when they're weak from a bad fever.

### Mending

This cantrip summons a variety of tiny (hand-sized and smaller) magical sprites who swarm over a chosen broken object attempting to mend it (over the course of 1–6 rounds).
Small-scale repairs like torn wineskins, muddy clothing, a broken handgrip on a sword, and similar repairs that anyone could fix with two to four hours of devoted work gets handled in seconds.
More elaborate repairs to complicated objects might require an Intelligence check, or at the GM's discretion could only be possible if the wizard has taken the Cantrip Mastery talent.

### Prestidigitation

This cantrip produces magic tricks and small illusions.
One casting usually gives you a minute of fun.
The magic has nowhere near as much real world force as mage hand.

### Spark

This is a minor fire creation spell, enough to light a pipe, or a campfire, or even a page or two of an unprotected spellbook.
It doesn't work against living beings or against things that couldn't easily be set on fire with a few seconds of steady application of a candle.
The target of the spark has to be nearby and in sight.


<If source="DATP">

### Animate Quill

Animate a quill, a piece of charcoal or similar object to write down words as you instruct it.

### Deep Pockets

Put an item in a pocket, from where it disappears into a small pocket dimension.
The item can be as long as you like, as long as it fits through the pocket’s
opening. You can pull the item back out as a quick action at any time. At the
end of the cantrip’s duration, or if the physical pocket is destroyed, the item
falls out.

### Detect Magic

You notice lingering magic and supernatural effects within your field of vision.
If an effect is concealed on purpose, the DM can require a skill check to detect
it.

### Erase
  
Permanently remove non-magical writing or painting from a scroll or a sheet of
paper, parchment, or similar surfaces.

### Fire Shaping
  
Enlarge or reduce a non-magical fire, change its color, shape, or intensity.
After the spell ends, the fire returns to its natural shape, determined by the
material that is burning.

### Grease
  
You create a slippery area where you touch the floor or an object. Anyone who
attempts to move through the area or tries to hold on to the object must succeed
at a save to do so.

### Gust of Wind
  
Create a strong puff of air that is sufficient to extinguish candles, torches,
and similar unprotected flames. With a successful skill check, the gust is
strong enough to even extinguish lanterns and other protected flames. It pushes
back insects and other small flying creatures, smells, and smoke clouds. It does
not affect larger creatures except for a dramatic waving of hair and clothing.

### Locate Minor Object
  
Divine the location of an object you are very familiar with, within a range of a
few meters. This spell is very handy to find keys, glasses, and other things
that get lost around the house.

### Mustache
  
This incantation grows a mustache on the target. Rumors are that it is part of
an entire suite of spells that create a wide variety of hair and beard styles,
however, this specific formula has proven to be a runaway hit at the court of
the Elf Queen (of all places).

### Nascent Magic Aura
  
Give an item an indeterminate magic aura, which can be noticed if it is examined
for the presence of magic. Upon closer examination and a hard difficulty skill
check, the examiner can determine that the aura has no other effect than to
create the appearance of a magical enchantment.

### Perfume

Create a pleasant smell on the target object, or at least hide a hideous one.

### Recall Familiar

You summon your familiar back to your shoulder, or a location next to you, from
up to a few hundred feet distance.

### Recording
  
For the next few minutes, you record the surrounding sounds into a small gem.
The gem holds the recorded sound and can replay it as long as the cantrip lasts.

### Still Image
  
You produce an illusory image, roughly the size of a portrait painting, for the
standard duration. It’s two-dimensional, doesn’t move, and doesn’t react to
touch. You can make the image transparent or opaque.

### Sundial
  
Summon a small sundial on your open palm that shows the current time, even in
places where no sunlight is available.

### Sunshades
  
Summon a black screen in front of your eyes that blocks excessive sunlight.

### Ventriloquism
  
You throw your voice to appear to come from a different location. This is
especially effective if the target can’t see you speak.
