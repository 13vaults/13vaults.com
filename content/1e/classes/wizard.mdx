## Basic Attacks

<Vault.AbilityList abilities={props.getAbilitiesByType("Basic Attack")} />

## Class Features

Wizards have four class features: Cantrips, Cyclic Spells, Overworld Advantage, and Ritual Magic.

<Vault.AbilityList abilities={props.getAbilitiesByType("Class Feature")} />

## Class Talents

<Vault.AbilityList abilities={props.getAbilitiesByType("Talent")} />

## Cantrips

### Alarm (standard duration)

The cantrip creates a minor watch-sprite that can be instructed to scream if someone comes through an area or touches an object.
Watch-sprites are notoriously stupid and sleepy, but with the right talking-to they might stay focused for the duration of the spell.
At higher levels, the spell might summon little fanged spirits buzzing back and forth serving as both visual and actual deterrents.

### Arcane Mark (standard duration)

The cantrip creates a magical sigil on an object or person.
These sigils are usually plain to see, though a deliberately invisible mark can be made.
It takes a difficult perception or magic check to notice.

### Ghost Sound

This spell creates false noises emanating from somewhere nearby.
The effect is like an exceptionally good version of throwing your voice, if your voice could create a wide variety of sounds.
Attempted distractions with the cantrip are DC 15 challenges in adventurer environments, higher as you move into champion and epic environments.
If someone is using ghost sound against the PCs, a Wisdom-based skill check can identify the sound as a magical fake.

### Knock

This cantrip summons a magical servitor three to four times as big as your closed fist that swarms around the door and attempts to punch or push it open (depending on whether you want to be quiet or announce your presence).
Success is determined with an Intelligence check against the environment's DC using an appropriate magical background.
This cantrip does nothing to avoid any traps that might exist.

### Light (standard duration)

This cantrip creates a fairly wide and consistent field of light, up to 30 feet in diameter, though it isn't bright enough to dazzle.

### Mage Hand

This cantrip creates a small telekinetic effect that lasts a round at most.
At best it's about half as strong as the wizard's own strongest hand.
At worst it's half as strong as the wizard when they're weak from a bad fever.

### Mending

This cantrip summons a variety of tiny (hand-sized and smaller) magical sprites who swarm over a chosen broken object attempting to mend it (over the course of 1–6 rounds).
Small-scale repairs like torn wineskins, muddy clothing, a broken handgrip on a sword, and similar repairs that anyone could fix with two to four hours of devoted work gets handled in seconds.
More elaborate repairs to complicated objects might require an Intelligence check, or at the GM's discretion could only be possible if the wizard has taken the Cantrip Mastery talent.

### Prestidigitation

This cantrip produces magic tricks and small illusions.
One casting usually gives you a minute of fun.
The magic has nowhere near as much real world force as mage hand.

### Spark

This is a minor fire creation spell, enough to light a pipe, or a campfire, or even a page or two of an unprotected spellbook.
It doesn't work against living beings or against things that couldn't easily be set on fire with a few seconds of steady application of a candle.
The target of the spark has to be nearby and in sight.

## Utility Spell

When you choose spells during a full heal-up, instead of taking a standard spell, you can choose to give up a spell slot to memorize the _utility spell_ at the same level.
When you take the utility spell, you gain access to a range of useful non-combat spells of the level you memorized it or below.
You cast each _utility spell_ at the level of the spell slot you gave up for it.
You can give up multiple spell slots to take _utility spell_ multiple times.

Choose from among the following utility spells:

<Vault.AbilityList abilities={props.getAbilities(["Feat Tiers"])} />

<Vault.AbilityList abilities={props.getAbilitiesByType("Utility Spell 1")} />

<Vault.AbilityList abilities={props.getAbilitiesByType("Utility Spell 3")} />

<Vault.AbilityList abilities={props.getAbilitiesByType("Utility Spell 5")} />

<Vault.AbilityList abilities={props.getAbilitiesByType("Utility Spell 7")} />

## 1st Level Spells

<Vault.AbilityList abilities={props.getAbilitiesByType("Spell 1")} />

## 3rd Level Spells

<Vault.AbilityList abilities={props.getAbilitiesByType("Spell 3")} />

## 5th Level Spells

<Vault.AbilityList abilities={props.getAbilitiesByType("Spell 5")} />

## 7th Level Spells

<Vault.AbilityList abilities={props.getAbilitiesByType("Spell 7")} />

## 9th Level Spells
