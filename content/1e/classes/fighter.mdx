      We were so frightened when that mass of people came for us.
      But then she arrived, and everything changed.
      She stood between us and the mob, her sword at the ready.
      It was like watching a storm descend upon the city gates.
      One downed after another, she held them off until they eventually retreated.
      We owe her our lives... she was the only one who stood up for us then.

Fighter weapon attack maneuvers deal damage based on the fighter's level.
You also don't have to keep track of upgrading a 1st level maneuver into a 3rd level maneuver, because all the maneuvers function at your level.
You can change which maneuvers you know and have ready whenever you gain a level.

## Class Features

Fighters have two class features: Extra Tough and Threatening.

<Vault.AbilityList
  abilities={props.getAbilities(["Extra Tough", "Threatening"])}
/>

## Class Talents

Choose three of the following class talents.
You get an additional fighter class talent at 6th level.
Fighters have flexible attacks called maneuvers;
you roll your attack and then choose which maneuver you want the attack to use.
You only get to use one maneuver with each attack, so it's usually best to choose maneuvers with a few different triggering rolls
