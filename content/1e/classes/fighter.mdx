Fighter weapon attack maneuvers deal damage based on the fighter's level.
You also don't have to keep track of upgrading a 1st level maneuver into a 3rd level maneuver, because all the maneuvers function at your level.
You can change which maneuvers you know and have ready whenever you gain a level.

## Stats

Initiative, AC, PD, MD, Hit Points, Recovery Dice, Feats, and some Talents are level dependent.
