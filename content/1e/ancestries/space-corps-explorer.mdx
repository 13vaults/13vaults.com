    description: |-
      You've got an array of technological gadgets in your belt—an anti-
      grav booster, a narrowbeam comm projector, a holoshell and so
      forth. You can use these gadgets to cast a non-magical duplicate
      of _utility spell_ (13th Age core book, page 150) once per battle or
      scene. You cast the spells at your level, or one level below. You
      need to make an Intelligence skill check to pull off the effect. The
      DC for the check depends on the effect desired:

      _Featherfall_: DC 15  
      _Disguise self, hold portal_: DC 20  
      _Message, levitate, “speak with item”_: DC 25  
      _Water breathing, scrying_: DC 30  

      If the test fails, you fail to cast the “spell” and you can’t use your
      survival belt again until after the battle or scene.

      **About the belt:**
      The technological version of _speak with item_
      doesn’t let you talk to a magic item, but does let you analyse the
      physical composition of an object, detect hidden forensic traces
      and so forth, which gives you roughly the same information as
      a _speak with item_ spell. (The belt is genetically keyed to its
      owner, by the way, so it can’t be used by anyone else. It is also
      nearly impossible to remove by someone unfamiliar with it,
      except through ingenuous lockpicking or massive force.)
