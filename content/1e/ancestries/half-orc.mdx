    description: |-
      Once per battle, reroll a melee attack and use the roll you prefer as the result.

      Note that you can't use this ability if the attack drops you to 0 hp or below. You've got to be on your feet to sneer at their attack and recover.

      - tier: champion
        description: If the lethal attack reroll is a natural 16+, you can use _lethal_ again later this battle.
