### Surprising

Once per battle, subtract one from the natural result of one of your own d20 rolls.

          You gain an additional use of surprising each battle, but you can only
          use it to affect a nearby ally’s d20 roll.

### Heritage of the Sword (Elf)

          If you can already use swords that deal d6 and d8 damage without
          attack penalties, you gain a +2 damage bonus with them. (This bonus
          doesn’t increase miss damage.) Otherwise, if your class would
          ordinarily have an attack penalty with such swords, you can now use
          them without penalties.
