        description: |-
          If you can already use swords that deal d6 and d8 damage without
          attack penalties, you gain a +2 damage bonus with them. (This bonus
          doesn't increase miss damage.) Otherwise, if your class would
          ordinarily have an attack penalty with such swords, you can now use
          them without penalties.
