      Many histories would have you believe that Tieflings are simply humans who made a deal with dark powers, but the truth is far more complicated than that;
      the blood of demons runs through their veins, and their power comes from an ancient and mysterious source that we have yet to fully understand.

  lead: Born with the blood of infernal heritage, Tieflings are granted the ability to wield chaotic power.
abilities:
  - name: Curse of Chaos
    _type: Racial Power
    description: |-
      Once per battle as a free action when a nearby enemy rolls a natural 1â€“5 on an attack or a save, turn their roll into a natural 1 and improvise a further curse that shows how their attempt backfires horribly.

      A curse should have about the same impact as a typical once-per-battle ability.
      For example, a typical curse might lead to the cursed attacker dealing half damage to themself with their fumbled attack and being dazed until the end of their next turn.
      The GM may reward storytelling flair and/or limit the suggested effects of the curse.
