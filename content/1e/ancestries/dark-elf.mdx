          Once per day, you can instead use _cruel_ to deal 5 ongoing
          damage per level against an enemy you miss or that you roll a natural
          odd attack against.

    }
  >

    Once per battle, deal ongoing damage to a target you hit with a natural even attack roll as a free action.
    The ongoing damage equals 5 times your level.
    (For example, at 3rd level you would deal 15 ongoing damage against a single target.)
    As usual, a normal save (11+) ends the damage.

    A critical hit doesn’t double this ongoing damage.

  <Vault.Ability

    feats={
      <Vault.Ability.FeatList>
        <Vault.Ability.Feat tier="adventurer">
          If you can already use swords that deal d6 and d8 damage without
          attack penalties, you gain a +2 damage bonus with them. (This bonus
          doesn’t increase miss damage.) Otherwise, if your class would
          ordinarily have an attack penalty with such swords, you can now use
          them without penalties.
