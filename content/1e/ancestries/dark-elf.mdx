    text: Those who think all Dark Elves are deceitful and treacherous have never met my friend, Valtor. He's as loyal and true as any dwarf, and twice as skilled with a blade.
    cite: A speech given by the legendary paladin Sir Roland during his retirement banquet, sometime during the 11th age.
  lead: An agile and quick-witted elven folk known for their mastery of swords.
abilities:
  - name: Cruel
    _type: Racial Power
    description: |-
      Once per battle, deal ongoing damage to a target you hit with a natural even attack roll as a free action.
      The ongoing damage equals 5 times your level.
      (For example, at 3rd level you would deal 15 ongoing damage against a single target.)
      As usual, a normal save (11+) ends the damage.

      A critical hit doesn't double this ongoing damage.
    feats:
      - tier: adventurer
        description: |-
          Once per day, you can instead use _cruel_ to deal 5 ongoing
          damage per level against an enemy you miss or that you roll a natural
          odd attack against.

        description: |-
          If you can already use swords that deal d6 and d8 damage without attack penalties, you gain a +2 damage bonus with them.
          (This bonus doesn't increase miss damage.)
          Otherwise, if your class would ordinarily have an attack penalty with such swords, you can now use them without penalties.
