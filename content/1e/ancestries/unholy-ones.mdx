      The screams of them... as their bodies twisted and contorted, their minds consumed by the dark power they sought to wield.
      Those screams...

    description: |-
      Once per battle when you heal using a recovery, you may activate this power.
      One nearby enemy loses hp equal to 1d4 X your level, and you regain half that many additional hp.
      However, if the damage kills the random enemy, you only regain half as many hp as they had before the damage.
      So if you do 16 damage to an enemy and that doesnâ€™t kill them, you regain 8 hp; if you do 16 damage to an enemy and they only had 12 hp, they die and you only regain 6 hp.
    feats:
      - tier: adventurer
        description: When you reduce a non-mook enemy to 0 hp with an attack, the closest nearby staggered enemy with fewer hp than you is dazed until the end of its next turn.

        description: When you use drain, gain a +4 bonus to your next attack roll, or +2 if drain reduced the enemy to 0 hp.
      - tier: epic
        description: The first enemy you hit each battle must roll their next d20 roll twice and use the lower result.
