On a result of 25&ndash;29, the PC is lulled by the dragon&rsquo;s words and the sight of the hoard; if combat occurs, the PC will be *stunned* during their first round. The dragon will make a suggestion to charmed PCs to leave and bring it more treasure for its hoard (while it prepares surprises for their return). Charmed PCs won&rsquo;t attack the dragon, but can make a normal save each round in battle to break the charm effect (or every day outside of combat).</p>"
