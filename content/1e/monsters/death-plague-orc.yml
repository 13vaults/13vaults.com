        value: "<p>When a creature contracts a death-plague orc disease, roll a [[1d4]] for the disease type and a [[1d6]] for that disease&rsquo;s symptoms after the battle. Until cured, at the start of each day (after each full heal-up) the PC makes a Constitution check (including any appropriate background) to determine the severity of the disease for that day, or if the PC is cured.</p><p>Full bed rest under the care of a healer reduces severity roll from a d6 to a d4 (so a severity check result of 18 would be 1d4 + 2 not 1d6 + 2). A PC under the care of and experience healer or someone who knows healing magic gains a +10 bonus to the Constitution check. At the GM&rsquo;s option, special ingredients or healing items, found via quest, can give additional bonuses to the check.</p><p>Disease Type (d4)</p><ol><li>Filthy Fever (d6 roll for symptoms that day)</li><li>Chatter Pox (d6 roll for symptoms that day)</li><li>Slug Scourge (d6 roll for symptoms that day)</li><li>Red Fever (d6 roll for symptoms that day)</li></ol><p>Filthy Fever Symptoms (d6)</p><ul><li>Slight temperature.</li><li>2&ndash;3: The runs. You gain 1 less recovery than normal after a full heal-up due to fluid loss.</li><li>4+: You have a hacking cough that sounds like insane laughter and are losing fluids. You gain 2 fewer recoveries than normal after a full heal-up and can&rsquo;t remain silent.</li></ul><p>Chatter Pox Symptoms (d6)</p><ul><li>1: Unsightly and painful sores, occasional shivers.</li><li>2&ndash;3: Running sores, shivering and chattering teeth. You take a &ndash;3 penalty to social skill checks and to attack rolls with spells.</li><li>4+: Infected sores, fever dreams. Your constitution is *weakened*. After each full heal-up, roll 1d4 + 3 to determine your starting maximum recoveries for that day. Each time you cast a spell that isn&rsquo;t at-will, there&rsquo;s a 25% chance it fails (but you don&rsquo;t expend the spell).</li></ul><p>Slug Scourge Symptoms (d6)</p><ul><li>1: Extreme appetite, nausea.</li><li>2&ndash;3: Vomiting up slugs. Whenever you make a non-combat Charisma check, roll 2d20 and take the lower result.</li><li>4+: The slugs are inside your lungs! After each quick rest, you lose 25% of your maximum hit points. If you drop to 0 hp this way, you enter into a coma until the next day.</li></ul><p>Red Fever Symptoms (d6)</p><ul><li>1: Scarlet stripes on the eyeballs, itching, buzzing in ears.</li><li>2&ndash;3: Blurred vision. You take a &ndash;3 penalty to ranged attacks.</li><li>4+: Fever, rage, and confusion. Whenever you roll a natural odd attack roll, you are *confused* until the end of your next turn. Ranged attacks have a 25% chance of accidentally targeting an ally (check before making the attack roll).</li></ul><p>Disease Severity (Con check each day; result affects d6 symptoms roll)</p><ul><li>1&ndash;14: d6 + 3</li><li>15&ndash;20: d6 + 2</li><li>20&ndash;24: d6 + 1</li><li>25&ndash;29: d6 + 0</li><li>30+: Cured</li></ul>"
