Any enemies already engulfed by the dodecahedron take [[10]] thunder damage.</li><li>The dodecahedron throws out whip-like tendrils and makes a sudden orifice attack against each enemy engaged with it. Then it pulls each nearby enemy next to it and engages that creature.</li><li>&nbsp;Hundreds of finger-size slimes slither out from the interior of the dodecahedron and begin worming their way across the bodies of each of its enemies in the battle. Until the end of the battle, when a non-ooze creature takes any damage besides ongoing acid damage, it also takes [[10]] acid damage.</li><li>&nbsp;The dodecahedron bounces and thrums. Each enemy engaged with it or engulfed by it must roll a save; on a failure, that enemy takes [[30]] thunder damage. On a success, it takes [[15]] thunder damage and pops free from the dodecahedron.</li><li>The dodecahedron hunkers down and produces acidic spikes. It gains a +4 bonus to all defenses until the end of the battle, and each enemy who makes a melee attack against it with a non-magical weapon must roll a save; on a failure the weapon dissolves. When a creature&rsquo;s weapon dissolves, that creature is *hampered* and *weakened* (save ends both). Magical weapons lose their bonuses to hit and damage until the end of the battle instead of being dissolved (but the owner is still hampered and weakened). They can be &ldquo;restored&rdquo; after the battle by taking a few minutes during a rest to re-attune them.</li><li>The dodecahedron moves, rolling around the battlefield, then makes a shlup&rsquo;n&rsquo;schlorp attack at the end of its movement with a +5 bonus. If the attack misses, instead of making a spasms attack the dodecahedron rolls about the area again and makes a second shlup&rsquo;n&rsquo;schlorp attack with a +10 bonus. If the second attack misses, it doesn&rsquo;t get a spasms attack and the dodecahedron&rsquo;s turn ends.</li><li>The dodecahedron makes a spasms attack. If it misses with either attack roll, after the attacks, it can make a stretch and engulf attack as a free action.</li><li>C: Pseudopod slaps</li><li>Each enemy engulfed by the dodecahedron takes [[40]] acid damage, and the dodecahedron heals [[40]] hp for each enemy it has engulfed.</li><li>The dodecahedron splits into an octahedron and a tetrahedron, and each one can act this turn (roll a [[1d8]] and [[1d4]] for the instinctive actions of each one). Divide the dodecahedron&rsquo;s current hit points into thirds, and give one third to the tetrahedron and two thirds to the octahedron.</li><li>The dodecahedron splits into three tetrahedrons, and each one can act this turn (roll a [[1d4]] for the instinctive actions of each one). Divide the dodecahedron&rsquo;s current hit points equally between the three new creatures.</li><li>The dodecahedron splits into two cubahedrons, and each one can act this turn (roll a [[1d6]] for the instinctive actions of each one).
