For each 6, one of them reassembles its horrid self and stumbles back into the melee that turn (add 13 hit points to the mob's hp total). To make sure a downed lemure is truly dead, an attacker can spend an additional [[7]] damage of the total dealt to finish the job instead of carrying that damage over to another lemure in the mob. Expending the right sort of limited-use power, such as a daily spell, might also keep a number of downed lemures totally dead. Once the last member of the mob drops, stop rolling to see if lemures rise up."
