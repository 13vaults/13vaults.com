In an indirect contest, the PCs might try to talk sense to one of the devil's dupes or to discern suspicious activity while staking out the devil's secret network. The honey devil is an expert at what it does, so use DC 25 for any such skill checks. Assume that the devil is competent at slipping its influence through the network unnoticed. Failure might mean that the PC has succeeded in gaining information, which in turn sends them down a dead end or into a trap. In a direct confrontation, the devil is likewise hard to pin down, see through, or otherwise get the better of."
