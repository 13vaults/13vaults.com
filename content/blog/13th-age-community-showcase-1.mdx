One of the main reasons I created 13 Vaults was to highlight work from the 13th Age community.
This game system opens lots of opportunities to enjoy and create for others, and I'll be highlighting some significant community items in these showcases.
If you think I missed something, please let me know [on Mastodon](https://dice.camp/@13vaults) or [on Discord](https://discord.gg/m9DbPC6RsC) at sean#0003, or old-fashioned email at admin@13vaults.com!

## Owen's Medical Bills Bundle

https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/431123/Owens-Medical-Bills-Bundle-1-BUNDLE

https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/432798/Owens-Medical-Bills-Bundle-2-BUNDLE

> Veteran ttRPG blogger, developer, publisher, and writer Owen K.C. Stephens suffered a pulmonary embolism in February, resulting in his hospitalization. While still recovering from that ailment, he was diagnosed with stage 2 cancer. While he has every intention of overcoming this challenge and producing game material for years to come, and despite having medical insurance, the medical bills have begun to pile up. The ttRPG industry has come together to create a mega-bundle to help, with all proceeds going to help Owen with those bills.

Please help out Owen K.C. Stephens out in this moment of need.

The 1st bundle does contain 13th Age material, but if you can afford to purchase both, please do.

From the Patreon page:

Ryan Shatford, aka Paper and Dice, has been consistently creating 13th Age monster stat blocks on a weekly basis for years.
Ryan creates original monsters and converts monsters from other systems into fully-fleshed 13th Age stat blocks.
Not only does Ryan make [hundreds of 13th Age monster stat blocks](https://www.patreon.com/posts/13th-age-by-67575597), but the Patreon is pay-what-you-want.

We have been in very early talks with Ryan to get those stat blocks available on 13 Vaults, but definitely consider becoming a supporter of Ryan's patreon--I've personally benefited from it in my own game!

From the video description:

> A review of 13th Age. In the 13th Age of the world, adventurers seek their fortunes in the Dragon Empire while powerful individuals known as Icons pursue goals that may preserve the empire from chaos, or send it over the edge. It combines the best parts of traditional d20-rolling fantasy gaming with new story-focused rules.

This is another great resource to take a look at when if you are new and wanting to understand 13th Age mechanics and style!

Knights of Last call is a TTRPG community that discusses game systems, mechanics, and the philosophy surrounding all of the things we enjoy in our tabletop roleplaying games.
They released a 13th Age overview that goes _very_ in-depth into the philosophy of 13th Age and why they enjoy it so much.
Personally, I think every TTRPG enjoyer should watch this video and check out the Knights of Last Call patreon.
They put out tons of high quality video content and is well worth your money if you like discussing and enjoying TTRPGs with other folks!
