**Update 1.25.0** for the [Foundry 13th Age system](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/archmage)
was just released, fresh out of the Archmage's spell forges!

Among the changes in this huge update are
better **Resources** and automation options for custom resources and powers,
more support for **embedded macros**, **token improvements**,
**more configurable sheets** and other **UI features**,
further work on the **2e integration**, improved **Active Effects**,
**localization support** and even more stability, thanks to **dozens of fixes**!

Read a summary of the most important changes below, head to Foundry
for the update (remember to **always make backups** before updating your system!)--or read the [full changelog here](https://gitlab.com/asacolips-projects/foundry-mods/archmage/-/releases/1.25.0)
if you care about all the arcane details.

## But First: An Official Announcement

Before getting into the exciting improvements,
we're proud to announce that as of this update,
the community developed Toolkit13 system is becoming the **official**
system for [13th Age](https://pelgranepress.com/13th-age/).
You can expect more news on this soon!

For now, this is what system developer [@Asacolips](https://gitlab.com/Asacolips) had to say:
> The system is — and always will be — freely available and open source under the MIT license. We're still going to drive the development of the system as a community effort where we strive to make the best system to run your 13th Age game in Foundry VTT, but now we'll have the opportunity to improve the system officially with assistance from Pelgrane Press.
> We also have more coming down the pipe related to this, so stay tuned!

Now, let's dig into the update...

## Terrain Type Display

This one is for you, _Terrain Caster_ druids! Scenes can now have terrain types,
which get shown in a nifty new display next to the _Escalation Die_ if enabled.

## Improved Tokens: Temporary HP Bars, Oh My!

Tokens now display things like temporary HP correctly on their bars.
This was ~~yoinked~~ taken with love from the 5E system.

## Automation: Resources and Embedded Macros

### Resources

Resources (like _Ki_, _Momentum_ but also custom created ones)
were reworked and are now more powerful:

- Powers can automatically manipulate resources with a new syntax
  (see [this Gitlab MR](https://gitlab.com/asacolips-projects/foundry-mods/archmage/-/merge_requests/292)
  for details) to increase, decrease, set or unset them.
- They support handling multiple (comma-separated) resources in the resource field.
- They support inline rolls in the resource field.
- They support recoveries as a resource.
- They support the new _Combat Rhythm_ resource (for **2e**).
- System powers were updated to reflect these (use them for inspiration!),
  existing legacy powers should have their _Cost_ field migrated automatically.

Note that the former _Cost_ field for referencing resources in powers is now named _Resources_.

### Embedded Macros

In step with the above changes around better automation,
the recently added support for embedded macros
got even further improved:

- Embedded Macros are now supported for traits, equipment (magic items) and nastier specials.
- Embedded Macros can now alter most outcomes from item usage.
- New system-provided embedded macros were added (like for _Whirlwind_)
  and issues with existing ones fixed.

## Improved Night Mode

This is a small (but nice!) one. _Night Mode_ (dark mode) is now a per-client system setting,
so it needs to be set in Foundry's settings and is global for all sheets. Previously,
it was a per-sheet setting, meaning you'd need to manually enable it for each sheet.
(Fine for a player, but fun if you got lots of summons or are a GM,
and need to enable it for each monster!)

We also improved _Night Mode_ styling a bit and added it in a few previously missed places.

## Player Sheets

### Tooltips: Rules and Tips at Your Fingertips

The player sheet now has optional tooltips you can turn on in the system settings,
containing relevant SRD rules, explanations and tips for each sheet element.
These also include Foundry-specific hints where appriopriate (for example,
explaining what is automatically handled by the _Quick Rest_ button, or how
multiclassing works with the class name input).

We anticipate these will likely be more useful for new players when first learning
the system or creating a character, as they take up quite a bit of screen space.
Or maybe for GMs, who only look at PC sheets for reference anyway,
and having the relevant rules referenced may be useful!
For this reason, these are a per-client setting and off by default.

![Kin tooltip for 2e. Helpful, right? This is one of the shorter ones though. Please don't look at the tooltips for Death Saves or HP.](/images/blog/foundry-13th-age-system-update-1-25-0/kintooltip.png)

### Customize and Hide Parts of the Sheets You Don’t Use

The sheet settings now allow you to hide parts of the sheet.
Your group doesn't care to count different coins, uses another currency system or none at all?
No problem, check the option and the currency part of the inventory is hidden!
Don't use _Incremental Advances_ or *One Unique Thing*s? (Heretic!)
Tick the setting and they vanish from the sheet, no longer taking up that space.

Also comes with an option to **hide empty power sections** in the _Powers_ tab. So if the
character doesn't have any _Flexible Attacks_, that section is hidden. This one
is probably worth considering for everyone.

### Lock Sheet Settings and Import Powers

As you may have noticed in the image above, you can now hide the
**Import Powers** button sheet settings tab for players.
Whether you've got new and inexperienced (or young!) players,
ones that tend to fiddle and break stuff, or play with people you just don't
know that well or for whatever other reason:
You can now lock sheets down a bit. Use this responsibly, trusting players
and granting them freedom over their sheets is usually a good idea,
there is a reason these new settings are off by default!

### More Player Sheet Improvements and Fixes

- The _Roll Mode_ selection in sheet roll dialogs (like for _Skill Checks_) now
  actually works (and defaults to whichever roll mode is selected in the box above chat).
- If you remove all icons or backgrounds from a sheet, that whole section now gets
  hidden, instead of the title remaining behind like a weirdo.
- Small improvements to colors, gradients, contrast and styling hopefully mean a
  more pleasant experience playing and using these sheets.
- Sheets no longer break when set to invalid levels; that's now correctly
  clamped to 1-10.

## NPC Sheets

NPC sheets got a bit of love too:

- The order of _HP_ and _Defenses_ on NPC sheets now matches Player sheets for consistency.
  Sorry if it takes you a bit to get used to!
- All items are now displayed on NPC sheets, regardless of type,
  so you can now see all the pieces of loot you dropped on NPC actors by accident.
  Which means you can also use this to track related equipment and loot on NPCs now,
  without them ending up ~~in the hands of the Diabolist~~ in the invisible ether.
- As mentioned, _Night Mode_ is now a global per-client setting, so you can now feasibly use that with NPCs.

## Localization and Translation Support

**Everything** besides the compendiums and _Import Power_ menu is now
fully translation-aware and ready for localization. The interface, the PC, NPC,
effect and item sheets, all the roll dialogs, even the trigger parsing!
This means that for the first time, it's now possible to translate the full system
and play in whatever language you want. A **full german translation** is in the works
and should release soon after this release, and other community members are working
on further translations!

Translation support for the SRD compendiums and the _Import Powers_ menu is slated
for the next major release.

## Some Other Goodies

- Work on **2e support** continues, quite a few small changes made it in for that!
- _Active Effects_ got a few improvements and fixes, supporting descriptions,
  Crit Range modifiers and bonuses and some other bits and bobs now.
- The chat roll context menu has a shiny new _Apply as Half Healing_ option.
- That same context menu also got its styling fixed and has proper hover effects.
  And roll results look a tiny bit nicer in chat as well!
- The system now correctly waits for 3D dice rolls (if enabled) to finish before
  updating any sheet UI and spoiling the results.
- Players are now correctly set to _Unconscious_ at 0 HP, instead of _Dead_.
  This also confers the _Helpless_ penalties to them, as it should.
- _Death Saves_ and _Last Gasp Saves_ got a few fixes.
- The _Show Players_ button for Item sheets now works correctly.
- Text trigger evaluation was improved and trigger detection should
  now behave more consistently.
- _Sequencer_ support now handles a few targeting edge cases correctly.
- Most chat card title images/icons are now hidden if empty. No more _Mystery Man_!
  Or at least, _less Mystery Man_!
- Trying to roll initiative without an encounter in the Combat Tracker now
  results in a helpful message instead of silently doing nothing (and laughing at you).
- A few useful things were moved around and made accessible for modules and macros.
